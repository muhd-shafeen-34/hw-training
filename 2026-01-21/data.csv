The challenges of the current market – struggling to find inventory, especially homes that are priced for both a willing buyer and a willing seller – have only motivated him more. Alex averaged more than $1 million in sales per day in 2021, totaling more than $375 million in volume for his best year to date and cementing his spot as the leading luxury real estate agent in the region. His goal remains the same: to find the perfect home for his clients before it hits the market, so they’re paying fair market price and not more. Being able to track down those before-market and private sales has made all the difference. “If you approach everything with a solutions-based mindset, you succeed,” Alex explained. “There will always be problems. A strong work ethic and knowledge of the market is not a secret. That’s always been the way to succeed in this business.” Notably, he sold two homes in 2021 offered at more than $20 million, including a home in Volk Estates, the prestigious University Park enclave, that set recent records for Park Cities sales. He calls his achievements a collaborative effort, noting that every successful transaction requires multiple parties, from other agents to appraisers, title companies, and the people he works with in sales and marketing at Allie Beth Allman & Associates. “People and relationships are the center of my success,” he said. “Each year – or each quarter – the market could require new strategies, but creating partnerships with people to solve problems will be a constant. That strategy transcends all markets.” A Southern Methodist University graduate, Alex holds a Real Estate Finance degree from the Cox School of Business. He is experienced in high-end home sales, representing both sellers and buyers, while specializing in the Park Cities, Preston Hollow and surrounding neighborhoods.  In addition to his ranking as #1 in Dallas and Texas by RealTrends/The Wall Street Journal, Alex has consistently ranked as a D Best Top Producer and Best Realtor each year by D Magazine.

As a result, she has an excellent source of knowledge on the local market, with an incomparable network of contacts and resources that form the foundation of her success in real estate. With a results-based work ethic and commitment to client service, she describes herself as “hyper-focused,” driven by her dedication to reliability, transparency, accessibility, and a strong desire to close business for her clients. Ashley has been frequently recognized for her accomplishments with prestigious industry honors throughout her real estate career. She’s been named top producer at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, as well as top realtor for five years (2014-2018, 2020) by D Magazine. Her professional training includes certification by the GRI (Graduate Realtor Institute) and the ABR (Accredited Buyer Representative), as well as the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing and Historic Home Specialist. “My values are honesty, integrity, and respect for others – all three are important to me and, in my experience, the only way to achieve true success,” she explains. “I like helping, serving people, and making a difference in my home and community. I’m a hard worker, dedicated, compassionate, and adaptable with strong communication skills.” On September 8, 2021, Ashley, and Chris Pyle launched the Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. It was a bold new stroke for the longtime friends and real estate associates. “Chris and I decided to join forces and form our own team at Allie Beth Allman & Associates,” she explains. Ashley calls creating a new team, “an easy decision,” due to the pair’s years of working together at The Haven Group, which Pyle founded in 2007. “We have similar beliefs and culture,” she says. “By pooling our time, experience, and resources we can offer an accelerated top-level service to our treasured clients.” Ashley says she works with a wide range of clients -- from first-time buyers to seasoned sellers. She enjoys working with clients relocating to Dallas and “showing off our beautiful city,” as she describes it, specializing in the Park Cities, where she lives with her family. She also has a depth of experience in East Dallas, Lake Highlands, Preston Hollow, and Bluffview. Brand differentiation is important to Ashley. “My top-notch customer service and passion for the ‘importance of home’ fortifies a deeply held belief that the process of buying and selling is a vital, intimate, and emotional one that requires thorough, honest, and steady advice … every step of the way.” And it is that differentiation that drives her real estate acumen. At the top of her list is a devotion to quality customer service delivered in her signature calm, personable, and positive style. “Past clients have shared that they appreciate my exceptional customer service, negotiation and problem-solving skills, as well as my patience, and staying involved during, and after the transaction.” A Shreveport, LA native, Ashley has been married for 25 years to Paul Rasmussen, Senior Minister at Highland Park United Methodist Church. The couple are parents to three children: PJ is a senior at The University of Texas-Austin; Arden, a sophomore, also at The University of Texas-Austin; and Luke, who is a junior at Shelton School in Dallas. Beyond a deep knowledge of various local communities, another of Ashley’s greatest strengths, she says, is understanding area school districts. “For one reason or another, early on our three children ended up in different school systems,” she explains. “When it comes to education – private vs. public, and so on -- I bring a wealth of information to clients.” Ashley received her bachelor’s degree in Business Administration at Northwestern State University as well as a master’s degree in Health Promotion. She is dedicated to her community and active with organizations including VNA Meals on Wheels, YMSL, Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center, Family Legacy, and various activities at HPUMC. In her spare time, Ashley enjoys traveling (especially summertime trips to the mountains), reading, cooking, exercising, Bible studies, and most of all, “spending time with my family.”",{},https://www.alliebeth.com/Contact/AshleyRasmussen,['214-704-4428'],['(214) 521-7355']

A native Texan, Chris is passionate about his work. He says he enjoys the fact that real estate is so topical and routinely comes up in discussions beyond the workplace. “It’s an important element in any community fabric – being an expert in real estate makes me better connected to my community and provides a continual incentive for me to help others.” Chris’s methodology for success is simple: “For me, it's a full-time, seven-day-a-week process. From the time I awaken to late hours, I’m focused on all my current transactions and listings, as well as prospects.” His schedule varies daily, even on an hourly basis, depending on the client’s needs. “One of my trade secrets is that I’m a chronic list-maker, which keeps me accountable throughout the day,” he smiles. He credits a devotion to consistent availability and dependability as the keys to his professionalism. “I’m resourceful and will find solutions to any issue real estate related,” he adds The Park Cities and surrounding areas, Preston Hollow, Lakewood/East Dallas, Uptown/Downtown are all areas Chris knows intimately. “Live where you work, as I like to say,” he explains. “I also enjoy working with an even mix of buyers and sellers since I have significant expertise on both sides of the transaction.” As far as specific real estate “superpowers,” Chris has substantial skills as a successful negotiator, which is at the top of his list. “Due to years of marketing experience, I have a clear understanding of what it takes to bring a home to market and maximize an owner’s exposure,” he says. Understanding all areas of Dallas and its distinctive regionalism is key when it comes to guiding buyers through such an important life decision. “I also have a successful track record of handling stressful situations in a calm, productive fashion, which is a valuable service to my clients,” says Chris. As a senior vice president at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Chris founded The Haven Group in 2007, which he successfully ran for many years. Then, on September 8, 2021, Chris and longtime Haven colleague Ashley Rasmussen took a bold new step when they formed The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. He says the pair had discussed building the partnership over several years. But when they finally made it official, “It just made good sense.” “Our new team is a partnership in which both of our names are prominent. In my two decades in real estate, it marks the first time to put my name on a brand. And I am proud to do this with Ashley.” He points to the pair’s similar styles, particularly when it comes to thoughtfully guiding buyers to the right decision. “Whether that is advertising, data analysis, or savvy marketing, in the process of the transaction or listing, our mission is to always put the client first,” Chris explains. “For Ashley and me, we’re not interested in growing beyond our bandwidth. We’re dedicated to making sure we are personally handling all our clients,” an attention to detail that is a defining hallmark of The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. Geographic proximity is another important element for the team: “I live in Preston Hollow, and Ashley’s in the Park Cities, thus we cover a lot of ground in terms of direct product knowledge.”",{},https://www.alliebeth.com/Contact/ChrisPyle,['214-726-5313'],['(214) 521-7355']

Frank and his wife, Jane, are Dallas natives and live in the University Park area where they raised their children. Why My Clients Come Back “I know there are many choices for Buyers and Sellers when choosing an agent. I am always so pleased when someone hires me to represent them and I do my best to ensure that their expectations are not only met but exceeded.” I am ready to put my years of experience and negotiating skills to work for you! Many of Frank's sales are repeat clients and referrals. He considers it the highest compliment when a past client endorses him to their friends and family. They know that Frank will handle them personally and put his skills as a seasoned, successful agent in their best interest whether buying or selling. The Secret of My Success The secret to Frank's success is honesty, persistence, perseverance, loyal friends and a loving family. Real estate is always changing and there are always new challenges to overcome.  In recent years, the lack of inventory at attractive prices has been a big challenge and Frank has been successful in ferreting out new listings and off- market properties by actively networking with other agents and making sure he knows all of the properties available.

Situations that initially seemed like the worst possible outcomes almost always turned out to be far from it.

You really want someone who feels like a friend, a protector, marketer, negotiator and collaborator. After spending twenty plus years as a broadcast anchor/reporter and owning my own interior design firm, I am proud to have earned my real estate license. I am a new agent who brings enthusiasm to the market along with my well-honed skills as a communicator, storyteller, renovator and designer. I’m especially humbled to work with Allie Beth Allman and Associates and with Susan Baldwin of the Baldwin Group, a longtime top producing team. I bring to the team a fierce loyalty to our clients; the willingness to work hard; and the energy to find solutions when met with unique obstacles.  As a longtime real estate investor in Dallas, I have extensive knowledge of the Dallas market having lived in Lake Highlands, Highland Park, Bluffview and University Park. Given my zip code history, I feel very connected to how emotional and exciting the search for the perfect home and neighborhood can be; I also know first hand the challenges of getting a home ready for sale. However, my family has always had an ally to help us conquer any real estate obstacle: a good realtor. Clearly, my family and I are not afraid of the moving process, but that doesn’t mean we haven’t experienced the stress and strain that can go along with buying and selling a home. One noted move was during the sweltering month of August while I was nine months pregnant and had a toddler and three dogs in tow. It seemed impossible, but with the help of our realtor, we made it work. We were also met with unique challenges while holding three properties during the housing market crash in 2008. Through good advice and faith that the market would rebound, we were able to profit through leasing and holding onto our investments. Historically, real estate has always brought my family financial security and assurance. I never tire of searching for the perfect home and making a space our own. In addition to my love of house hunting and negotiating, I also thrive on deadlines and have a proven track record of finding calm and clarity during chaos. I love meeting new people and discovering their stories. Plus, I firmly believe that buying or selling a home can be a wonderful experience and an absolute joy. I would be honored to help you create your favorite story in your next home.

She knows the market, she knows how to position your house to sell, and she understands all aspects of the process. She sold my house in 5 days for the price I was hoping for. Highly recommend Maureen."" ""Maureen sold three family homes for me in just a few months. From start to finish, she handled every aspect of the sales, from starting comps to closing with efficiency and professionalism. She is a wonderful advocate for and protector of her clients' interests. A very good marketer, she is energetic and proactive in creating the best-case scenario for a prompt sale. Maureen is a solid businesswoman who also is friendly and engaging, great to work with. She made selling our homes a great experience, and we had fun doing so. I highly recommend her services.” ""Maureen's market knowledge helped us immensely in the sale of our home. We had been approached by a builder with an offer and weren't sure if it was market price. We hired Maureen and she worked to get us a much better price in a very short amount of time. Maureen has high integrity, is a pleasure to work with, and puts her clients' interest first. I would highly recommend you work with Maureen on your next real estate transaction!” ""Maureen Frieze has represented us this year as both buyers and sellers. We did the 'buy' first. Maureen was patient and hard-working. She was never tired of sharing listings, or taking us to see the ones we were interested in. She never pressured us. She always acknowledged: 'It's a process'. We're happy with our purchase. Then she tackled selling our house in Lobello Estates. Again, Maureen proved to be a very hard worker. She helped us get out of the house we were selling, and recommended movers and subcontractors to help with necessary repairs. Then she went to work to get the best possible price for the house we sold. If you want a motivated, hard-working realtor who really knows Preston Hollow, please consider Maureen Frieze. If you want to look or sell elsewhere, she'll bring the formidable resources of Allie Beth Allman to work for you."" ""Thanks so much for getting our sale closed. You did a great job, from researching and giving us information regarding pricing and how the pricing changed to staying on top of the “to do” items. You were pretty much solely responsible for bringing closure to the “fence” issue by immediately communicating with the builder next door who had removed our fence creating a potential code violation issue. You have a wonderful style and manner- negotiating hard for your client but also having a practical common-sense approach to thorny issues. Thanks again, we could not have sold it without you!""",{},https://www.alliebeth.com/Contact/MaureenFrieze,['214-929-1166'],['(214) 521-7355']

He’s what some might refer to as a classic “renaissance man,” an archetypal entrepreneur with a long string of business successes. And when it comes to real estate agents, that can a very good person to know. To understand Mike’s present, it’s important to recognize his past. He is from Abilene, a Texan by birth with a distinctive professional background. “I’ve been called a ‘turn around guy’ by clients and the ‘guy who gets it done,’” he explains. “Usually while others are staring at their phones,”  he adds with a laugh. It is that kind of determination that’s made Mike an indispensable resource for his clients. Educated in Texas, Mike graduated the University of North Texas with a double major in General Business and Hospitality Management. “I began working in my family’s small manufacturing business as a machine operator before I could even drive.”  Together he and his dad would join forces to build Mike’s very first car, which, as it turned out, was the beginning of a lifelong fascination.  “Over the years, I have owned more than 300 cars,”  he says.  “I have five or 10 at any given time that I’m working on. In fact, I paid for my education working in hospitality and selling the cars that I rebuilt.” While attending college, he also started buying and selling condos in Dallas’s Uptown district where he did basic work while living in the renovation projects. Mike’s life took a turn in 2004 when a realtor failed to show for a routine closing. As a result, he got his own license and promptly generated $4 million in sales through his first 9 months in the business. With his family, Mike purchased an assisted living facility, Serenity Estates located west of Fort Worth in Mineral Wells. It was renovated, opened in 2014, and still operates to this day. The diverse qualities of Mike’s career provide for numerous strengths as a real estate agent. His experience as a general contractor, a deep understanding of the mechanics of homes, and direct access to skilled repair and craftspeople, plus an eye for detail, and knowledge about senior living issues provide tangible advantages to clients. He wakes up every morning determined to serve, which, he says, often means assisting with maintenance challenges and property issues that arise long after the sale.  “I strive to take the stress out of owning property by consulting wisely on what best fits my clients and makes the most of their return on investments."" He joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates Real Estate in November of 2021 because he wanted to be a part of a quality team, one that enjoys the admiration of clients as well as competitors, recognized as the area’s premier brokerage. Mike has lived in Oak Cliff with his husband, Ryan, of 23 years since 2005, “way before it was cool,” he chuckles. However, he works everywhere in Dallas-Fort Worth (as well as in Parker and Palo Pinto Counties), proud of the brand he’s carefully cultivated over the years, focused on experience, unique insights, and a sincere dedication to top-notch service.  “When you call me, you get me … not an assistant,”  he explains. Over the years Mike has consistently been recognized for his work, honored time and again by D Best, Advocate Best, and others, as well as a top producer at competing firms prior to joining Allie Beth Allman & Associates. A concerned community advocate, he volunteers his time to organizations including North Texas Scottie Rescue, serving on their Board of Directors since 2016.",{},https://www.alliebeth.com/Contact/MikeBates,['214-418-3443'],['(214) 521-7355']

During his time with Stapp, Raul earned a solid reputation as a hands-on, customer-focused expert, with a distinguished record. In 2016 he was named the company’s Rookie of the Year. Raul ranked among the firm’s top three producers twice and was Stapp’s number one producer in 2020.

During his career, he has also been an exclusive investor in new luxury homes in some of the hottest neighborhoods in Dallas.

He graduated with majors in Advertising as well as Markets & Culture. Raul’s college experience in the heart of the Park Cities helped him establish close personal and professional connections in the local market where he’s worked since finishing college. Always an avid learner, Raul takes pride in constantly honing his business skills. He closely follows consumer trends and buying-habits, all designed to assist his clients, and is fluent in English and Spanish, a bonus for international clients.
