Thank you Hala! From our hearts - it was truly lovely working with you! \" - Tania and Samir ★★★★★ \" Since buying or selling a home is a large investment, it is important to partner with the best-in-class capable broker. We have found that in Hala Adra. She helped us in two transactions, while we downsized: finding a pied-a-terre and also finding the right buyer for our house. In addition to being very professional and with a lot of knowledge in the DMV real estate market, we found Hala to be easy to work with and a very pleasant person to interact with. She is positive and enthusiastic. She is an advocate and not pushy. Above all, she is honest and transparent. She bases her recommendations on market data and presents her point of view as an ally. She then gives us time and space to ponder what she presents allowing for her point of view to simmer until it becomes our idea. She is persistent in pursuing the best approach, assessing the options, and methodically studying the risks and benefits of each. Hala is the consummate professional. She is hard working - at time taking our calls, or writing an offer, late in the evening. Although we were not an easy client, Hala never complained or changed her demeanor. She pays a lot of attention to detail and always has her antennas up for potential transaction risk (e.g. something that could derail closing, etc.). She looks after her client’s interests and ensures that each transaction is solid and virtually risk-free. We are very pleased with Hala’s results, and we highly recommend her for your real estate needs. \" - Debakey Family ★★★★★ \" Hala is exceptional at what she does. She has deep expertise, integrity, stellar relationships amongst her peers and only wanted the very best for my family&I. We were new to the area and looked at so many homes over a period of months in a complex and hot market, however, we always had the utmost confidence and solace in our agent. She went above and beyond countless times. We landed our dream home and she handled the process for us from a-z, we could not have done this without her and are so grateful for her tireless efforts and around the clock work ethic. She also led us to the very best attorney, home inspector and so on. A true professional whom we now consider a trusted a friend that we recommend to anyone & everyone who wants the best. \" - Omar B. ★★★★★ \" Hala was amazing throughout the process! she was extremely insightful, had excellent feedback and was always available. she helped us find the perfect home, lock it in in time and made the transition into the home seamless. I have already recommended her to several friends who share my experience and will continue to do so! Thank you Hala!!! \" - Ramzi Alami. ★★★★★ \" Hala is a true delight. She is a consummate professional, attentive to detail, and worked hard to keep me informed at every step and to ensure my goals as a client were met. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone looking for help with a real estate transaction in the DC Metro area. \" - M Razian. ★★★★★ \" Hala is a true professional. She worked with us on the sale of our home while simultaneously assisting us in identifying and closing on a new property. Through it all she helped us understand the process and market conditions while guiding us through all that is required for successful completion. I would highly recommend her and would surely work with her in the future. \" - Firas Maksad. ★★★★★ \" I've had the opportunity to work with Hala both from a buyer's perspective at one point, as well as a seller's perspective recently. When I decided to list my property in the midst of a pandemic, I turned to her for guidance and advice. The end result was my property going under contract less than 24 hours after it, and only 2 weeks after deciding to sell it. If you are looking for a real estate professional that consistently delivers results, I believe you'd have a great experience with Hala. \" - Abdallah A. ★★★★★ \" Our review and our words don't even begin to give her the credit Hala deserves. She was the most amazing agent. We began our search for a home two years ago with very particular requests. Hala was incredibly patient with us throughout the whole process, constantly taking notes, and keeping a list of our needs, and working tirelessly to find us our dream house. She consistently took hours out of her day to show us four or five houses at a time. We so appreciated how she always gave her most honest opinion of the homes we saw and kept all of our needs and desires in mind. She never once pushed us to make a decision we weren't comfortable with, and in fact, told us when she didn't think a house would be right for us. We never felt pushed or pressured. When she saw the house we ended up buying, she immediately told us we had to see it because it met every item on our list. She was supportive, extremely helpful, and professional through the offer process. She always made us feel comfortable and fought in our best interest. She is truly the best agent you can find and we wouldn't have our perfect home without her. We recommend working with her 110%. \" - May K. ★★★★★ \" Although I am an attourney, I was looking for a real estate professional into whose hands I could put the sale of my home and whose judgement and ethics I could trust completely. Hala was perfect and pleasant!! She gave me good advice on pricing, found a fantastic company to stage the property, and thought of and through every detail. She was a joy to work with, and I recommend her highly!! 5-stars+! \" - David M. ★★★★★ \" Hala Adra was amazing!! She was very knowledgable and well informed. She answered all our inquiries in a very informed manner. She also understood our requirements and used that to narrow down our search and save us time. She was also very nice and accommodating and professional at the same time. She helped find our house with the specifications that we had in mind and when we put it on the market to rent it, it rented within 2 days!! She is an excellent negotiator and she is not too pushy. I would recommend Hala Adra in a heart beat for anybody who wants to buy, sell or rent real estate. She is excellent and she did a superb job for us . She was excellent and I give her 5 stars!!! \" - Shiraz ★★★★★ \" Incredible service from the first time we spoke. She was always willing to answer questions day or night, and she used her experience in the DC/MD/VA area to guide our home buying. We could not have been any happier!! She was with us every step of the way, even to the time of closing. Behind the scenes, she took the time to visit various homes at different times of the day to help us get a sense of direct sunlight. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for in the area. She always treated us like we were her only clients, and we will never forget all of her hard work to help us find the house of our dreams. \" - Jon ★★★★★ \" Hala helped us buy a home that we needed in zip code 22101 which as you know is currently very competitive and it is a buyers market. She helped us achieve our desired results. So we recommend Hala for your real estate needs. Hala is knowledgeable and knows the Mclean market very well. \" - Suraj ★★★★★ \" Hala has been a blessing to our . Very professional and personal service. Recommended highly if you are looking for a real partner that cares about your interests. We bought and sold our through her, she understood and clarified to us the market dynamics surrounding our home and that helped us have smooth transactions both ways. \" - Nidal ★★★★★ \" Hala was very professional and knowledgable. A real pro, very responsive and reliable. We had used another realtor prior to finding Hala, and we are so glad we found her. She helped us find our dream home and sell our first home. Would highly recommend. \" - Chris ​​", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/halaadra/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/halaadra", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/halaadrarealestate/?hl=en"}, "email": "hala.adra@compass.com", "title": "Associate Broker  |  Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7039804041", "7033106111"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7033106111"]}

Client Testimonials ★★★★★ We’ve known the Taylor Agostino Group for years, but it wasn’t until I bought and sold a home with Steve and JoJo that I realized how exceptional they truly are. They guided me through smart pre-sale updates, timed the market perfectly, and helped me navigate over 10 offers to sell for $240k above asking—all while finding the perfect next home for my family. Their patience, honesty, and integrity stood out at every step. Even after closing, they’ve continued to be a trusted resource. I hope I’ll be in my new home for many, many years to come, but if I ever need to make a move, Steve and JoJo will be the first people I call. It’s a no-brainer. Elizabeth Field ★★★★★ We just sold our home of 33 years with the superb expertise of Steve Agostino and his team. Every step of the way Steve was there for us, taking out the stress out of a difficult time. The stress came in unexpected waves: a slow spot in the market - Steve repositioned the marketing - we found an avid buyer but plumbing and floor joists failed inspection (90 years old house) - Steve found superb plumbers and carpenters to fix without delaying closing - then the closing! - Steve was there to explain and monitor the settlement agent.

I've sold over $30 million in the last 2 years, helping 42 families buy or sell their home along the way. Importantly, my buyer clients usually did not have to pay the highest price , even against as many as 22 offers! My clients who have sold their homes in this very different market have been armed with the best strategies to leave no money on the table, and to keep their sale together. I'm an expert negotiator, and I'm proud that Northern Virginia Magazine , Washingtonian , and DC Luxury Magazine have all named me as one of the DC area's Top Agents in 2019-2023. More important to me than any success I’ve had in my career, though, is the impact I have on the lives of my clients. With over a decade of real estate experience to draw from, I arm every client with the knowledge they need to navigate such a momentous financial milestone with confidence. The outcome? A seamless, successful life transition—and the results to show for it. I make a habit of cultivating good relationships with my colleagues, which directly benefits my seller clients when it’s time to get up-to-the-minute info about the market and the competition. Just as comfortable in the city as I am in the suburbs, I routinely leverage my deep connection with the Northern Virginia and DC areas to match buyer clients with their ideal neighborhood that’s near transportation, work, schools, and nightlife. I grew up on the Virginia side of GREAT FALLS and have lived in the Logan Circle, Adams Morgan and Dupont Circle neighborhoods in DC. I truly know what it means to work, live, and play in the DMV. Fittingly, this first-hand knowledge translates directly into crafting location-driven investment strategies that build wealth for my clients. When I'm not helping clients buy or sell their dream home, you can find me posing in Savasana at a local yoga studio, cozying up with a great mystery novel, or biking the WOD trail on my new Trek hybrid bike. As a regular meditator, I'm interested in balance and well-being, and I seek to infuse both into my everyday life. Here’s a glimpse into a few of the (other) things that make me who I am: Food I can’t live without: Cheese Favorite area restaurant: King Street Oyster Bar Go-to cocktail: Slightly dirty Kettle One martini with 3 blue cheese olives Dream vacation spot: Hiking Glacier National Park What I love most about my job: My clients' smile after I've negotiated their deal Secret weapon: Healthy dose of gratitude Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \" Christine is awesome!

She does not, however, delight in talking about herself in the third person, so she will let some past clients take it from here: \"I've worked with at least four real estate agents through the years, I can say without reservation that Dillon was an entirely different class. She was exceptionally responsive, unfailingly thoughtful, relentlessly detail-oriented — though it might not seem as important to some — just a real pleasure spend a not insignificant number of working hours with. Whether it was staging our home, strategizing about negotiations or a gentle call at 9 pm remind us about the paperwork we failed send, we always felt like we were sure hands. I can't recommend her highly enough.\" - Z.G. \"Dillon is approachable, honest, has robust knowledge of the DMV housing market, and has the unique ability to translate complex home buying jargon into simple language for her clients. She and the Rebecca Weiner team made the home buying process truly enjoyable. We highly recommend Dillon and the Rebecca Weiner Group!\" - A.J. \"Dillon is a total pro and felt more like a member of our family than our realtor. She is friendly, chill, smart, funny, and has some very serious shark-like instincts when necessary. She helped us find the right house and masterfully walked us through the process of putting in an offer, worked closely with our lender to ensure we were comfortable with the offer, and made every move necessary to ensure we'd get the house.\" - K.C \"Dillon's strength is her ability connect with her clients as humans. We felt that she had our best interests at heart while we were buying. More than just our agent, she took on the older sister/guidance counselor role we didn't know we needed as first-time buyers. We closed on the property over a month ago we are still touch with Dillon to get her insights as we fix the place up and to prepare move . We highly recommend her.\" - A.M. \"Dillon is one of the coolest and most genuinely caring people you will ever meet. But don't let her chill demeanor and great sense of humor make you think she isn't also a real estate BOSS! She will fight hard and never quit until she has won. She went above and beyond to find us the house of our dreams during a very competitive time (Fall 2020 - Winter 2021) with a very limited budget! The market was nuts, but her attitude was nothing but positive and hopeful, which made us feel confident we would find a place that worked for us. She greatly exceeded our expectations, and we really enjoyed house-hunting with her. She's the kind of person you'll end up inviting over for a beer after you close because you just made a new friend.\" - L.J \"DILLON BABINGTON IS DC'S BEST AND MOST FABULOUS REAL ESTATE AGENT!!!!!

Zeno has over twenty years experience in the real estate industry, particularly focused on the real estate trends of Washington, DC with a sagacious discernment for the investment potential of Washington, DC real estate. He has a passion for real estate that he enjoys sharing with his clients, and knowledge invaluable to the first-time buyer or seasoned developer. Zeno’s clients appreciate and trust the unique combination of his personal attention and analytical evaluations through a service-oriented approach. Zeno is particularly poised to support development projects from conception to delivery, offering insight for development options to increase product performance, including commercial real estate. He is also supported by an experienced team of professionals to facilitate solutions to any obstacle in the process. Experiencing the value of real estate first-hand, Zeno’s goal is to develop generational wealth through real estate and facilitate others in doing the same. As Zeno says, “I started investing in real estate with less money than the cost of security deposit for an apartment and within a few years, had enough equity to buy and rehab my second investment property.” At the age of 21, with no experience or mentors in real estate, he reflects on the importance of professional real estate agents and the trust he placed in a diligent real estate agent in buying his first piece of real estate, a condo during a depressed 1998 market in Alexandria, VA. The navigation this real estate agent provided was especially invaluable, since this purchase was made after a weekend road trip to DC from Boston, during finals week at MIT and prior to moving for his first real job as a consultant for Accenture. Zeno became licensed and bought his second property, a fixer-upper in 2002 in the Petworth neighborhood of DC. Interestingly, in 2013, Petworth was named “the best neighborhood in the country to flip a house”, according to a report from Redfin, at least when looking at raw profits. He continued to invest in real estate and managed acquisition, development and sales for the team of his first condominium development in 2006, in the Columbia Heights neighborhood just prior to its major revitalization. Zeno and his team’s recent condominium project, the RyZen ( www.ryzen.com ), near U Street in truly magnificent. Zeno was born in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and made Washington, DC his home, spending the majority of his life in this beautiful city and witnessing the transitions of neighborhoods through this time. An investment in real estate is also an investment in the neighborhood, the city and the region. Zeno will not sell you anything that he has not bought into and he has bought into real estate investing in this city. He loves all that DC has to offer from the architectural beauties and serene green spaces, the intellectual depths of museums and artistic masterpieces of galleries, and the mixing of international cultures and history of this city in American culture.", "social": {}, "email": "zenobain@compass.com", "title": "REALTOR®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2022707124", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

I’ve always had a passion for real estate. Even as a kid, I’d ask my parents if I could join them while they toured model homes. Little did I know that 20 years later I’d be the one bringing clients through model homes and negotiating sales on their behalf! As a Realtor, I’m customer-driven, and always dedicated to exceptional service and results for my clients. I’m licensed in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, and I specialize in representing both buyers and sellers in the purchase and sale of single-family homes, row homes, townhouses, and condos throughout the D.C. metro area. I’m a graduate of Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda and I hold a degree in communications from the University of Delaware. My hobbies include biking, D.C.-area sporting and social events, boating (especially when I have the opportunity to take clients out on the Potomac), hiking, and helping out where I can in the community. I truly love the D.C. area, and I put my passion and deep knowledge of the area, along with 17 years of real estate experience, to work for each and every client. For me it's always been more than simply selling a home, but rather a deeper dive into understanding clients needs and then helping them find where they are meant to be.

Having completed many renovations, Max has built an understanding of how projects get done, and problem-solving skills. Even though early in his career, Max has already worked with a number of high-net-worth clientele and is familiar with the luxury market. He believes that the relationship is more important than the transaction, and finding the right investment/perfect home for his client is the number one priority. When Max isn't working, he enjoys cooking for friends and spending time in his gardens. As the son of two immigrants, family is not nearby, so his friends have become his family. These relationships he has built are the most important thing to Max and help make him a better agent Client Testimonials ★★★★★ We had such a great experience working with Max while searching for our first home in DC. Right from the start, Max took the time to truly listen and understand what we were looking for — not just in terms of square footage and amenities, but what would make a place feel like home and best align with our lifestyle. As first-time buyers, the process was naturally stressful at times, but Max’s steady guidance, responsiveness, and regular check-ins made everything feel far more manageable. In the tough and competitive DC market for single-family homes, that’s no easy feat. What we appreciated most was how patient, upbeat, and hard-working Max was throughout. Even when we got outbid or things didn’t go our way, he kept us encouraged and focused, and was always ready to jump in with a new idea or opportunity. Thanks to his persistence and support, we ended up in a home we truly love. Our family is incredibly grateful to have had Max as our agent, and we’d recommend him to anyone — especially if you want someone in your corner who’s thoughtful, trustworthy, and genuinely wants the best for you and your family. -Lawrence & Blair ★★★★★ Working with Max was such a pleasure. I went into the process never having bought property before, and Max made everything easy, simple, and low-stress. He has deep knowledge of the DC market; he was extremely generous in sharing his knowledge and time; and he consistently anticipated (and addressed) questions and concerns I had as a first-time buyer. I feel very lucky to have met Max and to have had the opportunity to work with him on my first home purchase. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell a home! -Fred ★★★★★ \"Working with Max at Compass has been an absolute pleasure! From start to finish and beyond, we are so fortunate to have had the guidance of Max throughout the process. My husband and I appreciated all the effort and time that was spent by the team on our perfect first home search. From viewings to negotiations to closing - you want to use them! I know we only just purchased a home, but we will definitely be using them in the future too! Thank you to Max, Lindsey and Daniel - we appreciate you so much!\" ★★★★★ \" Moving to an old folks home once one reaches 80 is a pretty traumatic experience but Max and Daniel held my hand and coached me to bid farewell to my beloved Beekman Place condo after living there over 20 years and loving every minute but I found I could no longer physically navigate the steps. Rather than roll their eyes at how dated the unit had become, they both offered incredibly useful suggestions as to what needed to be renovated, found me the best moving company in the area that handled my artwork with care, put no pressure on me timewise so that I could pack based on my own schedule, found an outstanding renovation crew to update and modernize my unit that has one of the best views of the US Capitol and the Washington Monument in all of DC, found a staging company that would put the best face possible on the completed unit, offered me updates on its progress and best of all, never made me feel like a bother when I needed a quick question answered or wanted another word of advice about the sale. They are honest, they know the real estate market so well and Max has a vested interest in Beekman because he own two units there and sits on the BOD as Treasurer. What more can any homeowner ask for in a realtor?\" -Kathy", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/maxbenninkrealtor/"}, "email": "max.bennink@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["9089027397", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

After completing his MBA at the University of Michigan, Stan joined a management consulting firm, where he specialized in hospital operations and construction. This eventually brought him to DC, where he met his wife Jeanie, settled down, and had two children: Todd & Scott. Right after they were married and before kids, they moved to an English basement apartment on Capitol Hill. It was on the Hill where Stan got involved in renovations, construction & real estate. At first it was on a part time basis, but it wasn't long before general contracting, renovating homes, developing commercial properties & residential condominiums became a full time business. In the 1980s & early 1990s he teamed up with well-known developer Bob Herrema and developed the Logan School Condo, Kentucky Manor Condo, the Tuscany Condo, the Carbery School Condo and the Hawthorne Condo to name a few. These were a handful of the condo conversion projects they developed on Capitol Hill, which were bold and risky moves at the time, but through some creative sales strategies they all sold out. These creative sales strategies involved selling the condos as investment properties to friends, family members, fraternity brothers, high school friends, relatives and the like. Since the majority of these buyers were out of town, there was a need for a local property management company. Stan & Jeanie started a property management company, which they ran for a decade or so. After which time they turned their management portfolio over to another management company. After his not-so-brief stint in property management, Stan started focusing on residential & commercial real estate sales and leasing. Shortly thereafter in 2001, his son Todd joined him in the business. The Bissey Team was formed. Stan's engineering and construction background coupled with Todd's sales and marketing background allow them to be great advocates and real estate consultants for both their buyer and seller clients. What sets them aside from their competition is their ability to prepare properties for the market. Together with their contractors, landscapers & stagers, they will work to transform their clients' properties, so that they can get top dollar. Their discerning eye(s) for correct construction practices and acute market knowledge make them invaluable resources for their buyer clients as well. You can find Stan & Todd all over DC, as they sell in every neighborhood, but more often than not you will find them on Capitol Hill.", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/thebisseyteam/"}, "email": "stan.bissey@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2028411433", "2025456900"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2025456900"]}

She routinely goes above and beyond to provide the exceptional service that she strongly believes her clients deserve. Laura particularly enjoys working with first time home buyers and helping them navigate the buying process. She remembers going through that sometimes confusing process herself more than a decade ago when she bought her home with the help of the District's Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP). In fact, it was that experience that inspired her to get her real estate license. Before shifting her career to real estate, Laura was a dedicated nonprofit manager. Whether raising money for housing programs for people with disabilities, managing a residential program for homeless youth, advising homeowners facing foreclosure, or educating residents about environmental issues in their homes, her work has always focused in some way on housing. Laura believes that owning real estate is an important component of strong, stable communities and a tool for building individual wealth. She believes that everyone deserves to live in a home that is affordable, healthy, efficient and resilient to the impacts of climate change. Laura loves her little blue bungalow in the NE DC neighborhood of Woodridge. When she’s not working on real estate, she's raising two amazing boys, cooking, seeking out unforgettable food experiences, working her way through the list of home maintenance/improvement projects, meeting up with her writing group at local coffee shops, trying to wrangle her rescue beagle Penny on a dog walk or traversing nearby rivers and trails on foot, bike or kayak.

I welcome the designation, as it connotes friendliness, warmth and a value system that rewards richness of character rather than holdings. My degrees are in psychology and marketing, and I credit them for my understanding of the need for and appreciation of finding one’s home. Real estate is a passion for me. The decision to purchase a home is the most significant one many of us ever make, and it impacts us on so many levels, including financial, intellectual, and emotional. To have a role in such an important time in the lives of others is a sincere privilege and a welcomed responsibility! While I am licensed and practice in the wide DC metro area, Capitol Hill is my home and my specialty. Many years ago (too many to mention) we purchased our first historic Capitol Hill home and lovingly restored it. We then moved through a series of historic Hill home projects on our own and today continue our purchase and renovate avocation with our children and my wonderful friends and clients. I know the DC market, particularly the Hill, in great detail, and especially enjoy sharing that knowledge with first-time buyers. Their joy in finding that first perfect nest is profound and infectious. In working with all my buyer clients, I love the challenge of finding the right home, of crafting a persuasive and attractive offer, and of designing one that can prevail in competitive bidding situations. For my seller clients, I love getting their home market-ready, establishing the right price point, and then presenting their beloved home in a compelling manner. My husband and I have three children, all raised on the Hill. They went to St. Peter’s, Gonzaga and Visitation, then Babson, Georgetown, and the University of Michigan. All of them are active in real estate (I still help out with their tile, masonry, and paintwork), and they are three of my favorite people on earth. What else holds my interest and energy besides real estate and family? Well, traveling with family to the some of the world’s most beautiful real estate. I am also devoted to our 11-year-old Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Ripken. He travels with us on our cherished family adventures and has been known to pull his weight on demolition days during our Hill renovation projects. In the service of my clients, I strive for excellence and leverage my talent, experience, and expertise on their behalf. While I have been blessed with awards and recognition based on industry metrics, the essence of my success is that I truly love what I do and the people with whom I do it.", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/deedeebranand/?hl=en/?hl=en", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/deedeebranand", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/CapitolHillRealtor/"}, "email": "deedee.branand@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2023697902", "2025456900"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2025456900"]}

She helped us buy a new home and sell our old one under very challenging circumstances. We did everything possible to drive her crazy and failed! She is super smart, always calm, insightful, kind, compassionate and has the patience of a saint. Her understanding of the market is incomparable. Her laser focus on every detail and asking the right questions was indispensable in difficult negotiations. We were deeply grateful the hundreds of hours she spent talking us through tough decisions, advising us on options, and going way beyond the call of duty to help us stage and sell our house in a difficult market. Peggy directed us towards the house we ultimately bought and really love—because she really knows her clients. We couldn’t have done this without her and cannot recommend her enough!” - Deb and Frank ★★★★★ Saying Peggy did an amazing job during our house hunting is an understatement. She was on top of everything, if it wasn't for her, I do not think we would have bought a house yet. Most importantly for us, Peggy was NEVER pushy. Every question/concern we had was addressed immediately, and she helped us every step of the way. Peggy also pointed it in a direction of great finance people that helped us get our ducks in a row. She is an all star! We will definitely use her next time we decide to buy or sell a place! | Buyer, Filip Popovic ★★★★★ Peggy did a fantastic job in helping us buy our first home. She provided excellent guidance to help us determine what exactly we were looking for, and was patient as we looked at a wide variety of houses in order to narrow down our preferences. Peggy is very knowledgeable of the area and was extremely resourceful when it came to answering the more difficult questions. She is very reachable and responsive, and was an excellent communicator when we were making difficult decisions.

Client Testimonials Scroll down for more ★★★★★ \" We recently had the pleasure of working with Amanda Briggs in purchasing a home in DC. The experience was truly positive from start to finish and we highly recommend anyone looking for a realtor to strongly consider her. Amanda is the consummate professional. She provided outstanding service and thoughtful insight, all with genuine kindness. In our search for an investment property, Amanda was patient as we explored different neighborhoods, candid in her impressions of homes we toured, and shared valuable insight in terms of both neighborhoods and home sales. We found her sense of aesthetics and ability to reimagine a space invaluable as we contemplated renovations to the properties. She was always responsive and quick to meet deadlines. There are plenty of realtors to choose from in DC, but what we think sets Amanda apart is not just how knowledgeable she is, but the level of customer service she offers her clients. Amanda was always willing to meet with little notice and made herself available when we needed a sounding board to think through options. When we encountered unexpected delays to our closing due to factors impacting our seller, Amanda zealously advocated on our behalf, listened to our concerns, reviewed pros and cons of different approaches, and in the end skillfully helped us reach terms that accounted for the delays. We could not be happier having chosen Amanda and highly recommend her. She is the friend and professional you want to have on your side when making one of the biggest decisions in your life.\" – Sylvia S. ★★★★★ \"Amanda and I have been working together for over a year, as I am preparing to put my house on the market.

Raised in the mountains of Western Pennsylvania, Erich learned to ski as soon as he could walk. His love for the sport led him to ski and teach others at a world- level. He traversed the world, tackling first descents in Alaska, and visiting Chile, Austria, New Zealand, and other countries to compete and train instructors. Stateside, he managed 135 instructors as the owner of a ski and snowboard school. After his fourth knee replacement, Erich had to shift gears. He came to Washington, D.C., to embark on a new adventure: real estate. He helped a friend start a finance company in the 1990s, buying, remodeling, and selling homes, and discovered his next passion. Erich learned quickly that real estate, like skiing, requires patience, dedication, and a steady hand to navigate the terrain. And like teaching, it requires a different plan for every person—and every home. The best part for Erich? Working closely with his clients to facilitate transactions. Tailoring his approach for each engagement, Erich negotiates optimal outcomes while his calming presence and easy communication style keep clients steady. Erich’s knack for closing deals has helped him become one of the region's top-producing agents, with over 90 percent of business coming from referrals.

Buying and renovating that place changed Ed’s financial life, and he began talking various friends into buying real estate. In 2000, he quit his job and went into real estate full time. His goal wasn’t just to become another real estate agent but to be a resource for first-time buyers and take some of the fear out of buying a home. Ed is extremely proud of the way he has developed his business. Ed has a very committed cadre of clients, many of whom refer him to their friends, eliminating the need to advertise for new clients. With sincere respect for his clients, Ed tries to always be mindful of what a daunting process buying or selling a home can be. Ed feels very lucky to have found real estate as a career and doesn’t take any of its benefits for granted. Ed said that he truly likes real estate and that is why he does well at it. In his free time Ed loves to travel: the more exotic the place the better. He has been to Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Dubai, Istanbul, Tokyo, Iceland, Bangkok, Singapore, India as well as many European countries. He has a friend that teaches at Oxford University, and he finds himself traveling to England often, he loves everything British. Still on his list of places to visit are Shanghai, Zanzibar and the Arctic Circle. Most of Ed’s clients are also a well-traveled group.

Juli comes from a family that stressed a strong work ethic – if you made a commitment, then you honored that commitment. Before embarking on her real estate career, I owned and operated a successful catering business, Juli Lieberman Fine Catering which won the year 2000 Small Business of the Year Award from the Arlington Chamber of Commerce. I also opened a local restaurant, Café, Café in Arlington. Café Café was reviewed and written up by The Washington Post and many local publications. I gave back to her community through her restaurant by providing weekly dinners to the local fire station. Customer service is always the major focus with my businesses and I always strive for excellence in all my endeavors. I decided she wanted her next challenge to be in real estate, so in 2010 I was asked to join a team as a buyer’s agent. I learned how to do business the right and ethical way through my mentor. After a short time with the team, I knew it was time for her to break out and launch my own real estate business. I saw the revolution of real estate coming and knew my focus was going to be web-based with an emphasis on social media. With my strong customer service ethic, I know the importance of delivering exceptional customer service to each client. Once I uncover the goals of my clients, I provides solutions that get maximum results for my clients. I love the Metro DC area and am familiar with many of the local neighborhoods. In my free time, I enjoy golf and served for 6 years as the Market Leader for the Metro DC area’s Women on Course, the fastest growing national community for business professionals and lifestyle enthusiasts interested in connecting through the game of golf. I also co-chair a dog rescue fundraiser, the Bichon Bash that raises thousands of dollars to vet and foster dogs so they can be adopted to their forever homes. My husband Kyle and I have fostered over 30 dogs since 2010.

His previous roles required perseverance, tenacity, highly developed communication and negotiation skill, often working with diverse multi-national organizations. Today, as a real estate professional, he applies these talents to a broad spectrum of discerning clients. Marc enjoys a stellar reputation his integrity and diligence and provides outstanding service, complemented by a contagious enthusiasm. He is a focused listener and a formidable advocate for his clients. With core values of professionalism and genuine concern for the best interests of his clients and their families, Marc works tirelessly to find the right home for his buyers and get the best price for his sellers. When Marc is not working with families to discover that special place called home, he enjoys outdoor adventures in the mountains, and the abundance of cultural, recreational and social opportunities offered in the Washington, DC Metro area. Click here to view Marc's website What Marc's Clients are saying: \"Marc Cowan = Wow! My wife and I call the DMV home and decided that continuing to rent was money down the drain. We finally made up our minds to purchase our first home. Buying a home is a daunting task. There were so many hoops to jump through that it seemed almost impossible. With Marc, though, we were able to rest assured that things would get done. While interviewing agents, we wanted someone who had the savvy and knowledge to navigate the waters of buying a home. Along with that, we needed a realtor with the endurance to push through the challenges first time buyers can bring and the grit to fight in a very competitive market. We interviewed several agents and Marc was our one and only unanimous decision. From the time, we met during our initial interview, we knew this was someone we could count on and who would put our best interest first. He arrived early for our initial meeting, looking dapper as always, with plenty of information for first time home buyers, and we could tell he really wanted to get to know our family and our needs for our first home. The questions he asked and the information he gathered proved invaluable in finding the right home for our family. Looking for homes can be exhilarating and gruesome at the same time. Marc made it easy by sharing updated information about homes as quickly as possible. He always promptly responded to queries, even late at night. My wife had him on speed dial and often had many questions. Marc had no problem with this at all and gladly maintained constant contact to keep us updated on any happenings. He also guided us through the tough breaks when homes were listed and went under the same day and explained the market trends in terms that made sense to us. When we finally found the home we wanted, he wasted no time in pulling comps, calling the agent to get as much information as possible, and walking us through the possible scenarios we would face in our offer. At the end of the day, if you do not have a realtor who can negotiate on your behalf with both professionalism and tenacity, you may see homes slipping through your fingers. Marc’s ability to gain insight into the seller allowed us to make a reasonable offer on the home that we wanted. He had us write a personal letter explaining why we wanted the home and encouraged us to include a picture of our family to go with the offer letter. Pure genius! We ended up having our offer accepted even though we were not the highest bidders. We know that if we’d had a different agent or tried to tackle this on our own, we would not be in the we are in today. Marc managed to negotiate hard after the inspection was done and all major points of contention were taken care of by the seller and listing agent. Marc is extremely professional, dependable, attentive, patient, and overall a pleasure to work with. He is the complete package in an agent. Without doubt we felt he was representing us and was constantly looking out for our best interests. He also has extensive contacts with different vendors such as inspectors, appraisers, title companies, and other professionals that you’ll need to work with during the process of buying a home. All the vendors that he recommended have also been very dependable and great to work with. We are so grateful to Marc and have already highly recommended him to many of our friends and colleagues. You won’t regret choosing Marc for any of your realty needs!\" - Lance and Luz Mercier", "social": {}, "email": "marc.cowan@compass.com", "title": "Realtor", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2024769790", "2024489002"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2024489002"]}

Experiencing so many different homes and communities at a young age gave her a deep appreciation for the emotional and logistical challenges of moving—insight she brings to every client she serves. Stacie moved to the Washington, DC area in 1997 and has been proud to call Reston home since 2003. Her introduction to real estate came in high school while working at a local firm in Raleigh, sparking a passion for helping people find the right home. Before returning to real estate full-time in 2005, Stacie built a strong professional foundation in accounting and consulting. Armed with a Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Accounting from East Carolina University, she worked with industry leaders PWC, KPMG, and Accenture. This experience sharpened her skills in analysis, problem-solving, and precision—qualities that now serve her clients every day. Stacie runs a 100% referral-based business built on trust, relationships, and results. She personally manages every client interaction from start to finish, supported by her experienced listing and transaction coordinators. Her approach is simple: every decision is guided by what is best for the client, not by making a sale. Clients describe Stacie as “the epitome of what a real estate professional should be,” a “calm, steady advocate” who “goes above and beyond” and “handles every detail with care, precision, and integrity.” Whether helping a family buy their first home, managing a cross-country relocation, or coordinating multiple transactions at once, she is known for her professionalism, market expertise, and tireless work ethic. Many clients mention her ability to anticipate needs before they arise, solve problems quickly, and make what could be a stressful process feel effortless. Stacie lives in Reston with her husband, Kirk, and their overly-spoiled yellow lab, Zac. She loves spending time outdoors, traveling to new places, and exploring the local restaurant scene—or cooking at home with Kirk. Her greatest professional satisfaction comes from knowing that the trust her clients place in her is repaid with results, lasting relationships, and a smooth, confident path to the next chapter in their lives. Client Testimonials ★★★★★ Stacie recently helped us sell our home and the entire experience was AMAZING! We had to relocate quickly for a job and wanted to sell immediately. Neighbors referred us to Stacie. From the time we first contacted her, we were on the market within 2 weeks and had 2 offers within 2 days. We got over asking price. She understood we wanted to move fast, and she delivered! So efficient and helpful every step of the way. Because of work schedules, it wasn’t easy for us to schedule a time for the closing. Stacie arranged an evening closing at our house and it was beyond easy! During our move, the movers damaged a wall and she had someone out the next day to fix it. Very knowledgeable, hardworking, and responsive. We could not have asked for a better experience. Thank you Stacie!! ★★★★★ We had the absolute pleasure of working with Stacie, and simply put, she is the epitome of what a real estate professional should be. From start to finish, Stacie went above and beyond to ensure every detail was handled with care, precision, and integrity. Not only did she successfully sell our home, but she also managed the sale of our parents’ condo and helped them purchase their beautiful new one—all with seamless coordination and constant communication. Navigating multiple transactions can be stressful, but Stacie made it feel effortless. Her knowledge of the market, calm confidence, and tireless work ethic set her apart. More than just a realtor, Stacie was our advisor, advocate, and steady guide throughout the entire process. Always one step ahead, she anticipated our needs before we even voiced them. Truly, a rare find in the industry—a real gem. We can’t recommend Stacie highly enough and will absolutely be calling her for any future real estate needs. Thank you, Stacie, for everything! ★★★★★ Stacie is truly exceptional and made all the difference in our home-buying experience. This was a major undertaking, as we were literally moving across the country. We were not familiar with the area and needed someone we could trust completely. Stacie worked tirelessly to ensure we were well-informed, demonstrating an exceptional level of knowledge and expertise. We toured countless houses together, both in-person and virtually. Stacie was honest with us throughout and extremely patient, having no desire to rush us into a house we wouldn't love. Ultimately, we found the perfect property and Stacie guided us smoothly through the buying process. She has remained in frequent contact as we settle, and continues to be our guide for services in the area. We cannot recommend Stacie highly enough! ★★★★★ I could not have asked for a better realtor! Stacie was extremely proactive and helpful from the first day I met her. She made me feel like I was walking through this process with someone who had my best interests at heart. Stacie always demonstrated exceptional professionalism, deep knowledge of the market, and a genuine commitment to helping me sell my home. I thoroughly enjoyed working with her. ★★★★★ The best accolade I can give Stacie is that she has now handled 3 real estate transactions for me, and I wouldn’t even consider someone else in the D.C. area should another one arise. When Stacie takes on a client, she takes them on 100 percent, handling everything from the dreaded paperwork to necessary repairs, market analysis, lining up movers, legal necessities, and I could keep going. If a stress-free, best financial outcome, and always available Realtor is what you are seeking, just look up Stacie Hennig Davis, and relax from that point on. ★★★★★ Stacie was a DREAM to work with. After having some not-so-great experiences with other agents, I decided to work with Stacie after being referred through my favorite lender! She truly listened to what WE wanted rather than telling us like my prior agent did. There were times when I felt like a frazzled hot mess during this crazy housing market, and Stacie was always able to reel me back in. I was always kept in the loop and walked through every step of the process. I never needed to micromanage my home sale because I trusted Stacie so much. She helped me stage my home beautifully and truly put in the extra effort and time as if we were family. I would recommend her to absolutely everyone. I felt such a great connection with Stacie and will truly miss working with her now that we have moved away. She was also able to manage my ELEVEN offers with ease by creating the most organized spreadsheet and negotiating to get me the best offer. I'm SO SO happy that I went with Stacie and I believe she played a huge part in putting more money in our pocket to put towards our next purchase. ★★★★★ Stacie met and exceeded my wife's and my expectations in all aspects related to helping us find our new home. My wife and I lived most of our lives in the Midwest, and we both landed new jobs in the Washington, D.C., area. Neither of us was very familiar with the Northern Virginia area or what areas would have everything we were looking for. Stacie listened to our needs and wants for a new home and quickly started suggesting areas and providing feedback on the pros and cons of each area. Stacie was extremely helpful, especially since we were not able to visit the locations ourselves due to still living in the Midwest. She was willing to visit any location we had a slight interest in within the first day or two that we saw the home on the market. She wasn't afraid to tell us when something didn't match up with the listing expectations. Stacie really gave us the impression that she wanted to find the home that was perfect for us, even if that meant extending the search or visiting more places than we initially expected to. She seems to have a great understanding of the Northern Virginia area and is always quick to answer questions via phone or email. We hope to work with Stacie in the future when our housing needs change. I strongly recommend connecting with Stacie and discussing what type of home options you are looking for. I'm sure she will lead you in the right direction! ★★★★★ We were absolutely thrilled working with Stacie. She took her time to explain all the pros and cons of every home we looked at. She was completely honest and gave us a professional opinion, which we truly appreciated. She followed up with essential information about our home and helpful timelines for when we needed things done. She is very organized and on top of everything! We highly recommend her! ★★★★★ Stacie Hennig Davis is extremely responsive and dedicated to her clients. Her relationship with mortgage lenders, title companies, and other realtors has allowed us recently to purchase the home we wanted during an extremely competitive sellers’ market. Over the last 12 years, Stacie has helped us with multiple transactions. We have bought three homes with Stacie and sold one with her. She helped me with my first home purchase (condo); then my first single-family when I was married, and also my second and third home as our family and needs grew. She has always found the balance between our needs, wants, and budget. The most important thing is that we can trust her. ★★★★★ Stacie was an efficient, expedient, and skilled realtor. She helped us by coaching us on helpful updates to our townhouse and had a plethora of contacts to help do the jobs. She expertly fielded each offer and objectively stated the pros and cons of each. In the end, there were many offers, and all were above the asking price. We could not have been more pleased with her service. She is a competent class act. We highly recommend her. ★★★★★ My husband and I had the pleasure of working with Stacie in finding our first home. She is knowledgeable and excellent at explaining real estate concepts to newbies like us. We started out going to tour houses with a couple of realtors, but many of them hesitated or gave us a very vague \"it depends\" when we asked for their opinion, and it is frustrating for inexperienced first-time home buyers to hear that. Stacie, on the other hand, gave honest, detailed, constructive feedback even though some of them weren't pleasant to hear. We were expecting at the time, so it was a lot of pressure for a nest, not to mention the crazy seller's market. But Stacie didn't rush us into overbidding or waiving all contingencies regardless of the house's condition. For a period of almost 4 months, we toured 3-4 houses almost every weekend. She remained patient and understanding. She wanted to make sure that the house we were getting would be in good condition, have good resell value and that we wouldn't have to worry about the big ticket items in the short future of moving in. We ended up with a lovely house that exceeded our expectations. Stacie does care that we get the house that we'll be happy living in. Overall, I would recommend Stacie to everyone I know because of her professionalism, knowledge, and ethics. ★★★★★ Stacie has been our realtor from a rental 10 years ago to our first home purchase and 2022 sale. She was fantastic on both ends of the transaction - patient and educated, helpful in advising us through processes we were unfamiliar with. We bought our most recent home 8 years ago and invested a fair amount over the years, making it a home we loved. We were not planning on leaving, but when my job took us elsewhere we knew Stacie would help us get the most from our property. She helped us prepare the home for sale, advising us on minor fixes and employing her own staging company to present the home in the most flattering light. We ended up getting multiple offers all well over ask and most importantly, exceeded what we hoped to achieve. Stacie helped us analyze the various offers and select the best one for our needs, which included a 2-month rent back. She continued to be on top of things through the sale, ensuring we received our rent deposit in a timely fashion. We felt comfortable throughout the experience, knowing Stacie was on top of every detail. I wouldn’t hesitate to use her again in the future! ★★★★★ Going above and beyond her duties as a broker, Stacie provided superior customer service. this is the second time I worked with stacie. this time, purchasing a home in Reston. Stacie is the definition of great customer service. When I was ready to buy, she helped me every step of the way. from finding the right place, putting together the offer, inspection, and reviewing documents to the closing, stacie provides timely information. most important of all, she kept in mind my interest above everything else. ★★★★★ I went to Stacie to purchase my first home after my mom hired her to sell her home. Stacie has been my agent twice, and both times, she went above and beyond. She is professional, has a wealth of information, and knows her stuff. She cares about her clients, and she will fight for you to get the best deal and be honest with you when she thinks something may fall short of your best interest. I highly recommend stacie. ★★★★★ Stacie has helped us buy our home, sell it, and buy another. we wouldn't want to go through it without her expertise and guidance. She stays right on top of things, explains everything, and pays close attention to every detail. Stacie is an outstanding real estate agent! ★★★★★ Stacie helped me to find my first home at the age of 24. she worked with me to find not only the location and amenities that I hoped for but also a place I felt safe in. now, 7 years later, she helped my husband, and I find our first single-family home. we could not be more thankful for her time, patience, and expertise. if you are looking for a fair and honest realtor, Stacie is definitely highly recommended by us! thank you so much for all that you do. ★★★★★ Stacie was such a great realtor to work with in both the sale of our old home and the purchase of a new one. she is professional, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. I truly felt that she wanted us to find the home that we loved and didn't feel any pressure to put offers on houses. She showed her true value in so many ways - from helping us show our home in the best possible light (and getting above the asking price) to helping us navigate contracts and closing - explaining everything at each step of the way.", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/StacieHennigDavis", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacie-hennig-davis-437a9120/ target=", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/staciehdavis/?hl=en"}, "email": "stacie.davis@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7034008402", "7033106111"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7033106111"]}

Berlin is where Nick still calls home and where he spent the first 19 years of his life with his family, lifelong friends, and neighbors, who all taught him the important values he lives today. Starting his work career age 12, mowing lawns & shoveling snow in the neighborhood is where Nick learned the importance of community and helping your neighbor. The town of Berlin exudes a culture of helping one another and that is what inspired Nick to pursue his first career in education as a Middle School Counselor, then Dean of Students at Lake Braddock Secondary school in Burke, VA. Nick's entrepreneurial spirit finally took over in 2006 where he began his real estate career with Coldwell Banker in Arlington. Seven years later Nick joined Long & Foster's Commercial Division where he developed strong analytical skill sets in working on large scale office, retail, industrial and land development transactions. However, Nick's love for homes and helping people soon led him back to the residential side of real estate and ultimately to Compass in June of 2017 where he is flourishing! Nick currently resides in North Arlington but has lived and worked as a Realtor all over the Northern Va area for the past 14 years. Nick has developed a keen insight into the DMV real estate market, created an endless database of contacts, and has a multitude of experience helping buyers and sellers achieve their real estate goals.

He spent countless days during his youth deep-sea fishing along Florida's Atlantic coast and in the Bahamas, as well as in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. He attended Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia, where he played varsity lacrosse and soccer. Mr. Fazio was awarded a scholarship to attend Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, where he majored in public policy. He also joined the Delta Tau chapter of the International Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta at SMU. In 2011, Mr. Fazio moved to Washington, DC, to take a job with Capitol Partners, Inc., a DC-based boutique lobbying firm. Spending much of his time working on naval, healthcare, and education appropriations, he was integral in the creation, organization, and development of the American Shipbuilding Suppliers Association. In the fall of 2012, Mr. Fazio began working as a Realtor. His business focuses primarily in the resale and buyer representation of single-family houses in Crestwood, 16th Street Heights, and Georgetown, among other Washington neighborhoods, as well as finding value-add opportunities for investment-driven clientele. His past clients include prominent attorneys, World Bank employees, embassy staff, and well-regarded real estate developers. In 2017, he and John Mahshie formed the Mahshie Fazio Partnership, which has been a top-producing team since it was founded. As Senior Vice President, he works with the Compass leadership and associates to increase their knowledge and understanding of residential and commercial architecture. He is also a contributing member of the Washington Mid Atlantic Chapter of the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art (ICAA), a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the practice and appreciation of the classical tradition in architecture and the allied arts, where he formerly served as the chapter’s National Coordinator. In 2024, the partnership planned, developed, and implemented the ICAA’s “New Heights” program, conducted from April 17-19 for 25 select students from the Washington Latin Public Charter School. The program included lectures by well-known local architects, landscape architects, designers, and academics and comprised lectures, field trips, and studio exercises to help the students gain an understanding and appreciation of the classical architecture tradition. The Mahshie Fazio Partnership has also represented several developers including Dilan Homes. In March 2024, we completed working with Dilan and architect Christian Zapatka on three new luxury residences in Georgetown. Both Messrs.

She is a co-founder of the Compass Chevy Chase office, where she is known for excellent timing and negotiation skills, pricing acumen, tasteful staging and a deep understanding of how the housing market moves. Peggy has a large network of devoted clients, often multiple generations in a family. She works almost entirely on referrals, a testament to her high quality of service and tireless efforts to meet the needs of buyers and sellers in the Washington area. When researching potential agents, prospective buyers and sellers typically hear that Peggy's personal touch transforms a transaction into a positive experience. They hear: \"she's available 24 hours a day\", \"she listens and hears my needs and priorities\", \"I knew that Peggy acted in my best interests\", \"she treats me like a dear friend\", \"my kids love her\". Those are also the reasons why other Compass agents look to her as a mentor and adviser on tough issues. Before her real estate career, Peggy taught art and photography in Montgomery County and DC public schools. She holds a masters degree and is a sixth-generation Washingtonian. She volunteers regularly at the Interfaith Works Women's Center in Rockville and she supports many local causes. Client Testimonials Scroll down for more ★★★★★ \" Peggy was absolutely wonderful to work with. She knew how much we loved out home and wanted to find the right buyer. She helped us figure out the best time to list our house and used her amazing contacts to find the perfect buyer (and the perfect price). She expertly walked us through the whole process so that even in the midst of all the change, we did not feel any added stress. Would absolutely recommend Peggy to anyone. \" ★★★★★ \" Wonderful. \" - Lori ★★★★★ \" Peggy Ferris was first-rate! We interviewed several realtors as we painfully moved forward to sell the house in which we had spent our growing-up years, and which had served our parents well for some 65 years. Peggy was the perfect choice because of her proposed market strategy; her personal identification with the character of the house and its location; her warm friendship which expressed her generosity of spirit and her awareness and respect of our emotional ties to the house. Her recommendations for renovation and staging were modest, but creative, and beautifully reflected our family’s happy years there. The house and property clearly had an aura. Moreover, Peggy achieved a sale during the rising pandemic in the Spring of 2020, a feat to be sure. We got our asking price; the buyers got a house they loved and could afford; closing was achieved virtually and without a hitch. No better result could have been hoped for. \" ★★★★★ \" We could not have asked for a better experience start to finish, from selling our TH in Rockville to buying a replacement property in Alexandria. Peggy is thoroughly knowledgeable and gave us clear, straight and accurate information. Highly recommended. \" - Elias ★★★★★ \" Peggy was great to work with on the sale of our home and purchase of a new home. She provided great advice on preparing for the sale during the time that we first started planning to sell. She alerted us to small, low-cost changes to make that we wouldn’t have thought of without her expertise. She explained various approaches that we could take to listing our home and helped us to decide on the approach that best met our timeline and comfort with risk. She was patient and helpful as the parameters changed for the search of our new home. She was an excellent advocate as we navigated some more tricky issues with the sale that ensured that we didn’t lose our dream place. With both transactions being finalized at the outset of pandemic restrictions, she was very communicative and helped us to understand and navigate the many new procedures that were just being developed at that time. She was a pleasure to work with, and we highly recommend Peggy Ferris! \" - Jedidah", "social": {}, "email": "peggy.ferris@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2024381524", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

My sales volume and track record has led to being awarded as a Top Producer by local associations. I've worked in new construction sales, home renovations and house flipping, as well as the general resale market with buyers and sellers. My love for homes formed when I was young. My parents and I would visit these gorgeous open houses on the weekend after lunch as a sort of family outing. My father immigrated here with absolutely nothing and was a serial entrepreneur who dreamt of success. I didn't realize this at the time, but going to large, luxury homes over the weekend was his version of visiting the goals he would ultimately achieve one day. My mom has a love for artistry and loved interior decorating; For her, it was simply enjoying the trips to see the latest trends of new homes and how they were designed. She truly enjoyed (and still does to this day) seeing the new styles that emerge within interior styling and decor. The blend of my parents' appreciations for homes really formed my own personal intrigue and love for the realm. Working with people in a real estate setting fits very naturally for me; It combines two elements which I very much enjoy...Visiting homes and engaging with people. This environment allows clients to feed off my energy since I'm so content with going through homes all day, and I feed off their energy since they're happy to see I'm happy.

Some of Toni’s clients have included First-Time Home Buyers with modest incomes to discerning buyers from the World Bank, IFC, IMF, IBD, UN, Amazon, US State Department, White House, Middle Eastern Royal Families, Global Businessmen, and many other organizations. Toni has buyers, sellers, investors as well as renters. Above all, Toni believes in being ‘yourself,’ in whichever way ‘that’ self is. Toni prides himself on being extremely professional, ethical, caring and above ALL judge-free. He connects with everyone on a deep humane level – a level that pushes newly found client relationships to a higher level of friendships that lasts forever. With more than 16 years in the Real Estate arena from commercial development to residential sales in the Washington Metro Area, Toni has excelled – especially in the residential field and has proven repeatedly that this niche of business is ‘his’ home and his passion. Skilled in the art of communication and negotiation, and having the ability to speak multiple languages from 4 continents (English, Spanish, French, Arabic and currently learning Mandarin Chinese), Toni brings a multi-cultural perspective that enables him to understand nuances and business practices related to the international cultures within the Washington Metro Area – an edge he employs to deliver his clients a globally-appreciated high-quality level of service. Toni believes in giving back to his community and helping others – he serves on the Board of KEEN Greater DC for young kids with disabilities. An owner of 5 rescued-dogs, Toni is a huge supporter of the Human Rescue Alliance in Washington, DC St. Croix Animal Welfare Center, in the US Virgin Islands. He also supports many local, domestic, and international artists including the Caribbean Museum Center For The Arts. Last year, Toni helped raise funds to complete the building of a Church in a remote village of Indonesia – the chapel will be a spiritual home for less than 25 poor and traditional peasant families. And he is a supporter of the La Clinica Del Pueblo supporting the health of the Latino immigrants in our community. Toni lives with his husband Craig Hollinger in the Spring Valley Community of Washington DC and calls St. Croix, USVI his second home. In his spare time, Toni meditates, channels his higher-self and other beings of love light, inspires and coaches others to be themselves and to do whatever it is that excites them the most. Client Testimonials Scroll down for more Toni helped my partner and I rent our first apartment in DC and then purchase a home in Capitol Hill two years later. All of his five star reviews will tell you how great of an agent he is (so true). But moreover, Toni is a great person, and that is the reason why I loved working with him and will recommend him to any of my friends who are looking for a home in the area. 1) Toni is judgement-free. Of all the places we saw, he was supportive, whether we liked the place or not and genuinely wanted us to be happy. He was never judgmental about our budget for our first home and didn't try to push us out of our comfort zone. He stuck with us until we found what was right for us. 2) I wanted to take one last look at a house on a Sunday evening before I put an offer in. I ended up changing my mind after seeing the house again, but Toni dropped what he was doing and rushed from the gym to the house to help me. The house we were looking at was abandoned mid-reno and was a bit of a disaster. He helped me figure out all of the houses' quirks for two hours-- if there were original wood floors under the laminate, if we could salvage any of the trim work, etc. He could've been doing something much more exciting on a Sunday night than lifting up dirty old flooring with me. He always took his time with us, and you would never think that he had several other clients. 3) He'll advocate for you and be on your team. There are countless times where I didn't think to ask for something, but he was always one step ahead of us and went above and beyond what I would've expected. Thank you, Toni! - Allyce M - November Toni is a reliable, knowledgeable, friendly, patient and resourceful agent! We have been working with him for over 2 years, he first helped us find a condo for and later another one for purchase. During the search, we were pressed for time and he saw 10+ condos with us less than 2 days and helped finalize all the paperwork within the same time - super efficient! During the buying process - he patiently saw 50(??)+ with us all across DC and Arlington, spread out over 6 months - he listened carefully and always always responded to all our needs and preferences, answered our countless questions and put with all our idiosyncrasies with a smile! Super thankful for all his help and hardworking in working with us and will always appreciate his efforts- couldn't have asked for a better agent! - Bratiral D -September . We just purchased our second home with Toni and he was absolutely amazing to work with. He left no detail behind and was so on top of every part of the process. In fact, we had a lot of difficulty with our lender being behind and he was terrific with helping stay on top of them for deadlines to make sure we were protected throughout the process and that our closing was not pushed back. Toni is not only know knowledgeable and experienced, but he is a true pleasure to work with. We wouldn’t want to have anyone else at our side and on our side when we buy a home. - Amanda D – September Toni was a great help, from start to finish. He is experienced, kind and helpful, and works seemingly all the time around the clock to help you. But he is also not aggressive or pushy with you as his client. I trusted him completely, which in the end is the most important trait when choosing between the 100s of realtors out there. I also really appreciate how non-judgmental he is - of your choices, and your timing, and ultimately of what works for you. He takes big shot clients and normal people clients, and works just as hard for everyone. I would highly recommend him - Genevieve C - September OH MY GOD! What an absolute pleasure it was to work with Toni to sell my tony Capitol Hill townhome. He is very professional and was able to provide me with an honest assessment of my property and needed updates to make it more attractive. Tony managed the renovations, the staging, the , and the an exceptional manner. I left town and relied on Toni to manage the entire process - I am so glad I did! Toni - thank you; thank you; thank you!!!! I cannot fully express my appreciation for all that you did for us!!!! - Scott C – September Working with Toni was absolutely wonderful. I have the utmost respect for and confidence in Toni's knowledge, experience, skill, ability and expertise in the real estate world. At one of the worst times, he was able to successfully, and in an amazingly short period of time, sell my elderly sister's condo. In addition to his professional excellence, I found him to be very caring, compassionate and understanding. He always lifted my spirits. Additionally, his response time to my calls, emails, texts was almost immediate. I can't say enough good things about Toni and I highly recommend him. - Nita T. – August Toni is an amazing realtor and wonderful to work with. As a first-time home buyer, I was anxious before beginning my search, but Toni put me at ease right away. I knew instantly I was in the best hands. I had a million questions, and Toni answered every single one, within minutes of me calling/emailing/texting. He is extremely responsive and not only arranged showings for anything I wanted to look at but also asked great questions to understand better what I was looking for. He was there for me every step of the way, and I am so grateful to Toni for making home buying a smooth and exciting process! - Emma P. – August,", "social": {}, "email": "toni.ghazi@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice-President | REALTOR® • Principal", "agent_phone_numbers": ["5712161075", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

She is so knowledgeable about the market and isn’t afraid to speak her mind (which is a great thing when you’re relying on someone for their professional expertise). She ALWAYS made sure to tell us every piece of information throughout our process. We literally trust her with everything when it came to finding us not only what we wanted but what we needed. We cannot say enough positive things to describe working with such an incredible realtor. Professional, stylish, funny, kind and above all Savvy when it comes to real estate! If your looking for a home … RUN to Sarah! \" ★★★★★ \" Sarah was excellent as a buyer's agent. She provided regular listings as both inspiration as well as serious options. She was available any time of the day or night for questions that we had as we were thinking through where to purchase our next home. When it came time to put in an offer, we had complete faith in her ability to represent us as if she were making her own personal home purchase. She offered shrewd advice, complete transparency, a high level of experience, and patience. \" ★★★★★ \" We weren't intending to purchase a new house and when the perfect property dropped into out lap, Sarah helped up lay out the necessary steps, structure a competitive offer, and then helped up to stay patient through the four month closing process. Her initiative with the sellers' agent kept the process moving and us informed. Definitely recommended, especially for complicated purchases involving long-time tenants and remote owners. \" - Joseph ★★★★★ \" We absolutely lucked out when we found Sarah on Zillow! She showed us a wide variety of places in DC, and we ended up purchasing a house that was a little tricky- it wasn’t listed on the market yet and it was for by owner. Sarah kept frequent contact with the seller to make sure renovations were being completed on time, and she negotiated our purchase so that the house never went on the market and we didn’t have to get in a bidding war. Sarah is professional, kind, quick to handle any issues that come up, and extremely helpful. I would recommend her to anyone. \" - Amanda ★★★★★ \" Sarah was fabulous - knew the DMV market, was effective at identifying neighborhoods that worked us. She knows the process, explained it patiently and clearly. Her responsiveness was almost immediate. Finally - she was very effective and engaging constructively with the opposing realtor. \" - Mary ★★★★★ \" We were introduced to Sarah with very high recommendations by a close friend. We found her extremely easy and pleasant to interact with, a consummate professional who is clearly very knowledgeable about the DMV area but at the same time who also invests time and effort to better understand and serve her clients’ needs. After we decided to work with her, she promptly exceeded expectations in every conceivable dimension. We could not have hoped for a smoother or more hassle-free of our home. It was truly a pleasure working with her, and we would recommend her very highly to prospective homebuyers and sellers alike. \" - Elena ★★★★★ \" Sarah is truly an awesome, full service realtor. She is excellent at helping at every stage of the process (including post closing renovation technician recommendations). I highly recommend her services to everyone. \" - Mary S.", "social": {"linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-minard-034a42aa", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Real-Estate/Sarah-Minard-Real-Estate-353843795188383/", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/minardsarah/"}, "email": "sarah.hake@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice President Licensed in DC | MD | VA", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2028564777", "2024489002"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2024489002"]}

We had multiple offers after our first open house despite the slowing down of the market. Susan is in a class all her own. She is a smart, strong, capable woman with a great sense of what it takes to get the job done. We loved working with her.

When we met Susan, she instantly put us at ease, saw what we wanted, and warned us about issues that she saw in potential properties that we were interested in. Closing was a breeze and we were absolutely thrilled to have a phenomenal home. After closing, Susan went above and beyond to help us turn the house into a home. She listened to what we needed done and put us in touch with workers who have done a beautiful job. When we found someone on our own who was giving us a hard time about a project with our floors, Susan put us in touch with a company that fixed everything perfectly.

Her experience in real estate coupled with her personality makes her easy to work with and guarantees that you will see results. If you are thinking of buying or selling a home, I could not recommend Susan Hand more. She really does go out of her way to provide “Over The Top” service to ALL of her clients.\" - Nicole M. ★★★★★ \"Susan Hand was referred to my family from our Selling agent in Seattle and was introduced as the “local expert” among other things. Our move was complex leaving Seattle for Arlington as part of a relocation for my family with two young children and having to do most of this virtually. Susan from the very beginning was warm, friendly and incredibly knowledgeable on the local market. It was clear from my initial expectations and requirements that I was not thinking about the areas correctly and Susan was quick to advise me on the areas and homes that would work best for me and the family. Susan visited multiple properties on my behalf, shared findings and was quick to rule out areas and homes that didn’t fit our requirements. Through her local knowledge she found what would soon to become our dream home and a new build home in North Arlington. Susan negotiated a very complex contract, worked diligently across the parties and helped me acquire the home in a very competitive market. Susan didn’t stop there, she helped my family fully customize my home, find other suppliers and referrals for me and has been with us all the way through, including meeting me and my young family from the airport on arrival to help us settle in to our temp home. Susan is quite simply one of the best real estate agents I’ve met, a true professional but with a genuine deep sense of care and sincerity for her clients.

Her desire to help create a sense of “community” began decades before she became an agent 20 years ago, and continues today. A past co-president of the Stanton Park Neighborhood Association and former board member of CHAMPS, she is currently on the Board of the Capitol Hill Community Foundation. Always active in her neighborhood, she is a longtime volunteer at innumerable community events, including the Capitol Hill Classic bike brigade, The Literary Feast, and as a bike marshal for Hill Family Biking. She and the Jeanne Phil Meg Team support and sponsor just about everything that happens on the Hill, and their annual client gingerbread decorating party is legendary. A CUA Architecture grad, Jeanne shares insights to help buyers and sellers alike envision possibilities in their homes, and knows first-hand how sweat equity works, having spent years of weekends restoring houses with her husband. She is particularly passionate about staging properties and after seeing her transformations, more than one seller has joked about reconsidering their decision to move. Extremely knowledgeable about how best to position a property, and equally comfortable helping first timers or seasoned veterans, she has a special affinity for helping sellers downsize and all that entails. Sellers have also benefitted from her ability to successfully pitch seemingly-insignificant items about their homes to the press, generating additional buzz and improving sales prices. Jeanne is a skilled negotiator, knows the importance of details, and is adept at creating “win-win” situations. Named one of the 100 Best Real Estate Agents by Washingtonian Magazine (and with her Teammates has been named a Washingtonian Best Team every year since 2016), her business is almost exclusively from referrals by other satisfied clients. She and the Team are particularly honored that many real estate colleagues have referred to and chosen to work with them personally, locally and across the country. Featured in Forbes as “the realtor who uses pedal power to sell houses,” Jeanne sports a jaunty in-town polka dot helmet when getting around or showing property by bike. She is actually a very serious cyclist who has toured extensively by bike with her husband throughout Western Europe and the US, cycled from DC to Canada, in Chile/Argentina, across Costa Rica, and has ridden several of the major summits to watch the pros ride the Tour de France (2013 Men’s, 2023 Women’s). She also enjoys sailing, snorkeling, and supporting the Washington Spirit and DC United.

A native Washingtonian, David's inspiration for success came from his parents, who owned a large portfolio of residential and commercial properties. From a young age, David worked alongside real estate agents to identify, negotiate and close the purchase and sale of property for their portfolio. David earned an MBA from Duke and a JD from George Washington University and practiced as a transactional attorney for a global law firm, where he represented corporate clients in connection with billion-dollar transactions. The sophistication in client service and excellence in work product cultivated by way of advising large corporations on critical, time-sensitive legal matters has been indispensable to his success in Washington’s luxury residential market. David has sold nearly $100 million of real estate over his career, earning national recognition from Tom Ferry and RealTrends as one of America's Best Real Estate Professionals, as well as local recognition from each of the Washingtonian and DC Modern Luxury magazines as an industry leader. While David is not advising clients and listing property, David enjoys exercise and tennis. He is a tennis enthusiast who competed in the Mid-Atlantic Tennis Association as a youth, ranking #3 in Maryland and #5 in MATA. David is avidly engaged in the community, including at the National Child Research Center (at which he serves as a Trustee), Maret, the DC Bar, and the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors. Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \" Working with David is a dream! We were new buyers to the DC real estate market with minimal knowledge but David expertly guided us through each step of the process. Always following up, answering calls/texts and patiently showing us many listings, David was the reason we were able to purchase the condo we wanted this spring. His negotiating skills helped everything move smoothly from purchase to close. David also goes above and beyond- he was super helpful with everything from cost savings to paint color suggestions- and is thoroughly enjoyable to work with. Can't recommend him enough!! \" - Caitlin R., Buyer ★★★★★ \" David guided us through selling our house after we found our dream home. He quickly identified the touch-ups that would help our home stand out and attract the most offers. David knows the market well and was able to advise us throughout the entire process – we felt well taken care of. Not only is David a pleasure to work with, but he also gets results. David’s brilliant marketing helped us sell our home quickly with multiple competing offers well above asking! David is a service-focused professional, partners with his clients to really understand their needs and advocates for them throughout the process. David will be the first person we call for future real estate needs! \" - Delfina R., Buyer & Seller ★★★★★ \" Professionalism matters. With so many realtor choices, it's easy to get overwhelmed when buying your house. David Hatef is a trusted professional who took the time to understand us, listen to our needs, and then helped guide us through the housing market. When it came time to put an offer on a house, he was the skilled negotiator we needed to ensure we walked away with our dream home at a fair deal. Being a realtor is more than handing out business cards and showing properties. A professional like David takes the time to know you, your needs, and then backs it with skilled knowledge in real estate pricing, negotiations, and market trends. We cannot thank him enough for guiding us through this process and recommend him to anyone looking to work with a professional who is authentic and genuinely cares. \" - Rob G., Buyer & Seller ★★★★★ \" If you’re looking for an experienced real estate agent who is a pleasure to work with, David Hatef is a real pro. He has excellent judgment and he will go the extra mile for his clients. I got to know David first as a buyer and then as a seller. He knows the DC area real estate market inside and out and he provides exceptional support and service for his clients. As a buyer looking to relocate in a very competitive market in 2020 David guided me through the steps to make a winning offer on a great property after an exhaustive search. Then, I hired David to help sell my former primary residence. You might think that selling a property is easy. Trust me, it’s not. I followed David’s professional advice and he had several useful tips and suggestions to increase the value of the property. He also does the work to maximize value and he does the research to find the best and most cost effective ways to present your property in the best possible way. The results speak for themselves as my house sold in 4 days at more than 8% above list price. Everything that David anticipated came to fruition. I can’t thank him enough for all of his assistance. Do yourself a favor. Hire David Hatef and follow his advice. \" - David C., Buyer & Seller ★★★★★ \" I unreservedly and enthusiastically recommend David Hatef. From start to finish, David was responsive, knowledgeable, an expert deal maker and tireless in his attentive client service. David clearly took pride in providing a concierge level of service and treated our relationship as one that will last a lifetime. A small example is when I wanted to move power lines in the backyard of the house - not a small undertaking, David tirelessly pursued Pepco until he was able to connect with an engineer who could make it happen. His attention to detail and knowledge were game changing. If you are looking for the most capable agent to represent you, then David should be your first, and only, call. I am recommending David to my entire network! \" - Buyer", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/davidhatefcompass/", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/davidhatef/"}, "email": "david.hatef@compass.com", "title": "Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2025502730", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

Having started out as an agent in the suburbs of Chicago, I moved to DC 20 years ago and was thrilled to discover the many vibrant neighborhoods the District has to offer. As an agent, my favorite part of the job was finding a home that perfectly matched my client's personality and needs. I went on to open my own brokerage and until recently, ran one of the largest female-owned brokerages in the DMV. The experience of managing 45 agents was an incredible learning opportunity. I became involved in their sales and truly saw the good, the bad and the ugly of this business. My goal was to help them minimize any bad experience and create a seamless transaction for their clients. The knowledge I gained as a broker was invaluable. After 12 years I realized I was ready to return to my true love--helping buyers and sellers. I am so excited to work with my close friend and amazing business partner, Craig Cobine, as the other half of The Sheila and Craig Group.

Ryan took his first foray into real estate in 2015, when he began purchasing rental properties in Baltimore. From there he expanded into managing rentals for other investors and family members in the area, until he was ultimately managing 19 units. He decided to switch gears, however, when he realized the day-to-day work of property management kept him from his first love - helping first time home buyers and new investors purchase homes. Now, with a solid clientele of both buyers and sellers, he has built a unique, relationship-focused strategy to help his clients win in competitive offer situations and sell their homes quickly and easily. Ryan is 100% client-focused, with an emphasis on fast and clear communication. He is always available for a free consultation, and happy to talk at length through any issues his clients are experiencing.

Her goal is to provide you with that knowledge and with the resources to make the whole process transparent and less stressful. Beth leads her team, Domo, which is a group of agents with diverse experience and knowledge of the DC Metro area.

Pairing compassionate customer service with a mastery of transaction management, Katri has made it her mission to find the right solution for buyers and sellers at every price point and phase of life. Katri was raised in Northern California and the UK. After receiving her undergraduate degree from the University of Vermont, Katri moved to DC to get her Masters in Forensic Science at George Washington University. While applying her degree to a career in Computer Forensics, she bought her first property with the guidance of an agent-turned-friend who noticed Katri’s knack for the business and encouraged her to pursue a real estate career of her own. Never one to waste valuable time, Katri got her license in DC, MD and VA and never looked back. Today, Katri is a dedicated agent and the trusted advisor you can always turn to. Recognizing just how momentous a decision it is to buy or sell, Katri is as detail-oriented as she is driven. She takes pride in managing every aspect of the transaction for her clients — from corresponding with lenders to presenting competitive offers to negotiating the optimal outcome. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned seller, Katri will get to know you, recognize your goals, and design a personalized experience centered exclusively on your terms. Her unrivaled local knowledge encompasses a distinct understanding of the many DMV neighborhoods where she’s lived over the years — including Alexandria, Bethesda, Capitol Hill, and Logan Circle (to name just a few). Regional expertise aside, she’s also the proud owner of multiple rental properties, making her uniquely positioned to counsel landlords on the complexities of DMV tenant law. Over the years, Katri’s penchant for people and industry knowledge have produced a lifetime sales volume of over $340M, but at the end of the day, it’s the milestones she helps her clients reach that matter most. When she’s not going above and beyond for her clients, you can find Katri riding horses competitively, traveling on a new adventure, playing with her pitbull, and spending time with her husband. In 2015, Katri donated her kidney to a friend. She has since been actively involved in the National Kidney Foundation as a member of their board and an advocate for living donors ever since.", "social": {}, "email": "katri.hunter@compass.com", "title": "Executive Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["6508885623", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \"Stefanie is one of the most effective, kind, and dedicated professionals I’ve ever worked with. We were juggling a lot when we bought our home and we’re first time home buyers, but Stefanie made the process of looking and buying easy. What is more, I’ve often heard that realtors need to be pushy in “this type of market” but Stefanie never felt pushy yet super effective. We had a home within about a month of looking and a true teammate in Stefanie. Also, home buying is more than just your realtor, it’s also who they know. Stefanie has a expansive, awesome network of home inspectors, mortgage brokers, etc. She always “knew a person” and they were always kind, responsive, and professional. Needless to say I HIGHLY recommend Stefanie. She’s the best!\" - Matthew L. ★★★★★ \"Stefanie was amazing throughout our home buying experience. As a first time home buyer, I would not have been able to navigate the market without Stefanie's guidance and expertise. Stefanie was with us every step of the way and was always available to answer any questions we had. Highly recommend!!\" - Chris B. ★★★★★ \"Stef is the best!! She is the only realtor we trust with our real estate needs. This is our 3rd transaction in 3 years. Works hard…always available…delivers extraordinary results. Highly recommend her!!\" - Jim B. ★★★★★ Stefanie was incredible! She was aggressive without being pushy. I truly felt like I was the priority. She looked for what I wanted and not what she thought was best for me. She was extremely responsive, upfront, and realistic. I never felt strung along or ignored. She continued to stay in contavt months after closing to see how we were settling in. I have already recommended her. I hope they are wise enough to use her! Keep doing what you you do Stefanie!\" - Trina R. ★★★★★ \"Stefanie was the best. She came out and met us at our home and went over all the selling information and answered all of our questions. Once the house was listed, she worked extremely hard to get it sold for us. We listed close to the holidays which was a difficult time to sell, however, due to her hard work and advertising we had steady foot traffic the whole time. She communicated almost daily with updates and progress. She was so responsive throughout this process including weekends and nights. She is so professional and knowledgeable to this process.

Mary quickly becomes a trusted advisor to her clients while using her depth of knowledge and experience to ease anxiety and decrease emotional distress. In addition, Mary is in the process of obtaining a certification as a Certified Senior Housing Specialist (CSHP), so she can guide seniors along the often-difficult path of downsizing their homes and their lives. “Many people become overwhelmed when even thinking about downsizing,” says Mary. “There are a lot of moving parts, and I can help organize, streamline and get things done. I can also just help get the process started. Sometimes that’s all someone needs.” Collaborating with her fully vetted team of service providers (including: plumbers, painters, contractors, organizers, move managers, estate attorneys, etc.), Mary works overtime to find the best, and most comfortable, process for each client, and walks them through every step. Her goal, she says, is simple: “I want to make people’s lives easier and better.” When she’s not working, Mary loves to travel, cook, go on long walks with her dog, Finn, and spend time with her two grandchildren. She also loves being on the water and recently joined a women’s crew team and took up rowing. She currently lives and works in Annapolis, MD, but spends half her time in DC where she maintains a thriving and robust business in the DMV – sometimes finding properties for clients in both locales.", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/people/Mary-Illes-Real-Estate-Expert/100066892405715/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-illes-0b754b6/", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/maryilles/?igshid=MDE2OWE1N2Q%3D"}, "email": "mary.illes@compass.com", "title": "Associate Broker", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2026422601", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \"We were recently successful in buying a single-family home in the very challenging DC market. Jesse was our realtor, and he was amazing through every step of the process. We hit a few glitches along the way, but Jesse provided the support and guidance needed to make the transition happen in the time frame we needed. He has a super positive attitude, which we really appreciated. He was very responsive to our calls/texts and always available for viewings. He answered our many questions with patience and always provided the needed information. We appreciate everything he did, and highly recommend him to anyone needing a kind, flexible, knowledgeable, and fun realtor.\" ★★★★★ \"Jesse was a great resource. Always helpful, never pushy, and gave honest feedback and advice. He made everything easy. In addition, he knows a lot about DC which is helpful in considering locations.\" ★★★★★ \"We worked with Jesse Johnson at the Synergy Group to buy our first property. Jesse was excellent; he guided us through the whole process and was a tremendous help. He was an advocate for us as a buyer and as a result the process couldn't have gone more smoothly.\" ★★★★★ \"I f you want a kind, hardworking and respectful Realtor Jesse is your guy. I cannot begin to express how grateful we were to have his guidance through every step of the way with purchasing our single-family home. He went above and beyond our expectations especially with the obstacles we had to get over in this very limited MD market. He is absolutely wonderful and there’s no way we could of done it without him. Jesse truly made all our dreams come true!\" ★★★★★ “ Thank you so much for helping us through this process. Thank you for your kindness and understanding. Thank you for the many hours you put into making sure all our questions were answered, all our concerns clarified, and the entire process so clearly explained. You kept us informed every step of the way and we very much appreciated it. All of this you did with thorough knowledge of how the housing market works and as a result we got the top price for our house! “ ★★★★★ “ Working with realtor Jesse Johnson was an absolute delight! His professionalism, efficiency, and knack for providing fantastic leads made my home buying journey an exciting adventure. Jesse's commitment to earning my trust, every step of the way, even after the sale was finalized, truly exceeded my expectations. I enthusiastically recommend Jesse to anyone seeking a passionate and trustworthy realtor. “ ★★★★★ \"Jesse immediately inspires confidence. He clearly knows what he is doing in the real estate market and I feel very fortunate that I was able to benefit from his advice and assistance. My property sold more quickly than I could possibly have imaged and I am still marveling at how smoothly everything went. I would definitely recommend him to anybody looking for a talented, hardworking agent.\" ★★★★★ “ I was discouraged by a prior listing agent's inability to sell my condo unit. Due to the condo unit not selling, I chose to make it a rental until market conditions became more favorable. Given the market, I was apprehensive about listing the condo unit for sale at the conclusion of the rental; but Jesse's expertise in dealing with a challenge is unrivaled. Starting with preparation of the unit for sale, (an arduous task that involved a tenant), to the cleaning, repairs, staging, and listing, Jesse was able to anticipate my needs and the needs of the market. He was keenly able to identify the most likely buyer for my unit and targeted that market with weekly open houses. After engaging potential buyers and receiving feedback, Jesse was able to pivot and sell my condo...just like that!!! It is not hyperbole when I say that if it was not for Jesse, I do not think my condo unit would be sold. I cannot recommend him enough! “ ★★★★★ “ Working with Jesse for my first home purchase was a wonderful experience. From the start, Jesse was able to leverage his deep knowledge of DC properties to help set up a showing for what became my first home purchase in a matter of days. Jesse also facilitated an incredibly smooth closing process and he helped refer me to contractors to do my renovations immediately after closing. Overall, it was a great experience working with Jesse and I highly recommend his services to others! “ ★★★★★ “ Jesse and his entire team were fantastic to work with! He was attentice and helped us through one of the most stressful situations a person can go throug. We cannot thank Jesse and the entire Synergy Group enough for helping us fin a home that we absolutely love! “ ★★★★★ “ Jesse is the most attentive realtor we have worked with. We met at an open house and were pleasantly surprised when he offered to show us another home immediately after. After discussing our interests, we toured about 15 houses together. Jesse constantly kept our ideas in mind and reminded us throughout the process which properties/areas would see the most appreciation and where we could add value-our largest concerns moving to DC. His knowledge of the DMV area was incredibly helpful and he found a great off-market deal that had everything we were looking for. “ ★★★★★ “ Being a first-time home buyer, it was intimidating to navigate the process of looking for a home. Jesse Johnson made the entire experience better than I ever could have hoped for. He was open and honest with me from the start, and he listened to all my questions and concerns. Jesse made me feel heard with what I was looking for in a home and never made me feel like I had to compromise on my non-negotiables even in the competitive DC market. Jesse is an exceptional realtor, and I am so thankful for all the amazing work he put into helping me find my home. He is professional, knowledgeable, dedicated, and an all-around delight to be around. It was an absolute pleasure to work with Jesse and I look forward to working with him again in the future when purchasing a home. “ ★★★★★ “ This is the first property I've ever purchased and it was even more daunting because my mom couldn't be with me, but Jesse brought a huge sense of relief and peace during this whole process. He answered every phone call, text, email -- whatever needed to be done, he made sure it got done. He gave me contact information for everyone and anyone I would need before, during and after I closed. Jesse made a very big, intimidating process feel not so scary which is something I definitely needed and appreciated.

I am a proud University of Richmond alum (Go Spiders!), and my passion for real estate and city living has landed me in our nation’s capital. As a resident of the District, I live the life that I work to sell. Whether buying or selling, it is important to have an advocate on your side that understands each step. With over a decade in the business, I understand the emotions and dedication that go into making a move from the first time you see the blank canvas potential, to the moment the keys are in your hand. The process can come with its share of challenges, and I work to make the process as smooth and enjoyable as possible. I truly believe that buying a home and selling a home are true accomplishments that are meant to be celebrated. Personally, there is nothing better than a good pair of cowboy boots, the cherry blossoms in bloom, an arm full of bangles, getting your passport stamped and a pop of color. When I am not found selling real estate, I am busy taking in all that Washington, DC has to offer or relaxing at my cabin in Virginia. My husband and I live in the Rosemont neighborhood of Alexandria with our one-year-old daughter, Stevie Louise, and a life-size cow statue in our front yard. I firmly believe it is important to always have fun in life and celebrate the things that make you happy.

Her nearly two decades at ABC News—navigating high-stakes, fast-moving environments in both domestic and international settings—shaped her signature ability to anticipate challenges, pivot with ease, and deliver exceptional results under pressure. Today, Gitika applies that same precision and ingenuity to help discerning buyers and sellers navigate the competitive real estate market with confidence. Her clients trust her to uncover extraordinary opportunities—including exclusive off-market properties—and to position their homes for maximum impact in a crowded marketplace. Known for her eye for design, deep market knowledge, and strong negotiating skills, Gitika ensures every detail is flawlessly executed from contract to close. With a proven track record of achieving record-setting sales and cultivating lasting relationships, Gitika has built a thriving referral-based business driven by her clients’ loyalty and trust. She understands that a home is more than just an asset—it’s a reflection of lifestyle, legacy, and dreams—and she approaches every transaction with discretion, care, and a relentless commitment to excellence. Gitika holds a B.S. in Journalism from Boston University. She lives in Bethesda, MD with her husband, two young sons, and their cat, Chutney. Outside of work, she enjoys discovering D.C.’s vibrant culinary scene, curating memorable gatherings, and finding joy in life’s every day moments. Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \" Five stars across the board- Gitika did not disappoint as a trusted guide, counselor and advisor during the daunting journey of homebuying in a pandemic-charged, absurdly-priced real estate market. Having worked with other agents, I'd say one of Gitika's differentiating qualities is that she has mastered the art of playing the long game but knowing when time is of the essence. We engaged her before we even moved to DC and she was always full of insights and inspiration. Specifically, she had us slow our roll when we were anxious to buy in a hot market, suggesting we wait to see if the madness died down. As luck would have it, the surge of sales subsided just as interest rates were poised to go up and Gitika helped us seal the deal for a wonderful property that checked almost every box on New Year's Eve Day. What many agents who dabble in the rough and tumble world of real estate may see as a paycheck, Gitika sees as a privilege, and it's because she recognizes the significance of her role that she has so many satisfied clients. \" - Buyer | Rockville ★★★★★ \" Gitika is incredibly knowledgeable, responsive, and personable. She made the home-buying process very smooth, and we felt very confident in our decision because of how thorough she was with providing us market insights. We highly recommend her! \" - Buyer | Bethesda ★★★★★ \" Gitika helped my husband and I purchase our first home and we couldn't be happier! She made the process as seamless as buying a home can be and was always there throughout the ups and downs. We are SO glad we were able to work with her and will continue to refer all our family and friends! \" - Buyer | Arlington ★★★★★ \" If anyone is thinking about buying or selling a home in the DC/MD/VA area, I strongly encourage you to reach out to our real estate agent (and now friend) at Compass, Gitika Kaul. Gitika was extremely patient and understanding as we traveled throughout the entire region, oftentimes changing course multiple times as we went. She has an uncanny ability to pick up on her clients' preferences and was able to expertly guide us through the offer negotiation and closing process once we found the right home. In short, Gitika made a stressful and challenging process more pleasant than we ever imagined possible. \" - Buyer | Bethesda ★★★★★ \" Gitika is wonderful to work with and represented my interests and feelings about what type of house I wanted to buy. She provided valuable input into the market and characteristics of the houses we considered. During negotiations and closing, she and her team made the process flawless and smooth. She is also an incredible communicator, responding to my emails and texts within minutes. A valuable trait in this fast-paced market. \" - Buyer | Capitol Hill ★★★★★ \" We had the pleasure of working with Gitika as our realtor, and we couldn’t be happier with our experience. From our very first meeting, it was clear that Gitika was the right choice. She came prepared with a comprehensive book detailing everything about the area and even knew intricate details about our home before we had discussed anything. Her knowledge and expertise were evident from the start. Gitika’s understanding and flexibility regarding our family’s timeline and needs made the entire process smooth and stress-free. When it came time to sell our home, she went above and beyond to help us stage it in such a way that the photos were simply breathtaking—honestly, the house didn’t even look like our home! Thanks to her staging expertise, the house showed beautifully. Throughout the entire process, Gitika was always available and responsive, answering our questions usually within an hour. Her professionalism, kindness, and willingness to go the extra mile for us truly set her apart. We couldn’t have asked for a better realtor and would highly recommend Gitika to anyone looking to buy or sell a home. \" - Seller | Clarksburg ★★★★★ \" Gitika is a rockstar! Not only is she an incredible, savvy real estate agent, she also has a heart of gold. I can say that with all sincerity, having worked with her closely through our entire home selling experience. Gitika has incredible insight into the local real estate market. She isn’t one to look over a simple comparative market analysis and come up with a proposed listing price for your consideration. She actually knows the market intimately and what buyers are looking for so well, that she can hone in on what are the most crucial necessary improvements and suggest additional enhancements that will provide a very impressive return on investment. She does this in a very sincere manner — at all times being deferential to the homeowner, never any high-pressure. It was a pleasure developing our relationship with Gitika both personally and professionally. We interviewed a number of potential listing agents and once we met with her we knew in our heart that she was the one that would best represent our values and goals. She did that and much much more! We had already purchased a property out of state and on our moving day we literally handed Gitika our house keys and our complete trust. We knew she would develop a great product, maximizing our eventual selling price. She has an incredible bullpen of contractors, landscapers, movers and stagers that is evidence of the trust that many others have placed in her. It is with this team and her hard work and vision that really delivered for us! She’s an exceptional person and an incredible real estate agent! She did countless seemingly small acts of kindness for us during the process; we didn’t expect that level of service and attention. Her marketing tools, although seemingly simple approaches to developing interest, are very effective. We could not imagine a more efficient and stress-free financial transaction, than the eventual closing process that she engineered for us. Gitika is a true artist, but what really makes her a rockstar is her ability to envision the perfect lyrics and orchestration, backed by an entire ensemble of exceptional artists — together Gitika and her entire ensemble provided us with an incredible, enriching and life-affirming performance and we will be forever in her de bt! \" - Seller | Bethesda ★★★★★ \" Gitika made selling our house so easy! It was the smoothest/quickest process, it happened while we were on vacation and by the time we got back everything was taken care of. It was a pocket listing that went very quickly and we got our exact asking price. Gitika also helped us quickly find our new dream home (new build) and worked closely with us every step of the way. It was a long journey to closing so it was great to have Gitika's help throughout. She's very responsive, attentive and thoughtful. It was really helpful to have her experience when going through this process. I would highly recommend her as a realtor! \" - Seller | Cabin John", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/GitikaKaulRealtor/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahujagitika/"}, "email": "gitika.kaul@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice President, Compass | Licensed in DC, MD & VA", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2028103395", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

As a third-generation Washingtonian Realtor, Olivia grew up attending open houses with her mom day and discussing market trends around the dinner table night. What Olivia didn’t know at the time, however, was that she would go on to pursue a real estate career of her own. Initially envisioning a future in finance, Olivia received her degree from the University of Delaware, only to realize after graduating that her true passion was back where it all started, at the center of her family’s collective story. The truth is, there’s nothing that Olivia finds more rewarding than guiding others through the complex yet momentous process of buying or selling a home. Today, Olivia is a successful DC Realtor in her own right, having forged a notable path within the industry while upholding the family legacy of excellence. Over the past 10 years, Olivia has built a hands-on, all-inclusive real estate experience, providing white-glove service for every client—regardless of price point or location. Olivia is best known clients for her uncompromising attention to detail, ability to fast, dedication to finding stress-free solutions, and her insistence on exceeding expectations at every step of the way. Above all, Olivia believes that knowledge is power. She recognizes that buying or selling a home is one of life’s most pivotal milestones, and she’s all too familiar with the anxiety that can often accompany such a transformative decision. That’s why Olivia strives to be every client’s advocate, leveraging her data-driven outlook to educate both buyers and sellers arming them with the necessary facts and information to make the choices that are right for them. Olivia offers extensive insight into the entire DMV area, and loves helping her clients explore all the twists and turns of the place she’s called home all of her life. Having been born and raised in the area, it’s no surprise that Olivia has curated a vast local network over the years—one that she attributes to the enduring connections she’s formed, and that she harnesses in her work for both buyers and sellers. She’s also a proven expert on a variety of specialized industry topics such as home renovation, interior design, historic preservation, and landlord representation—to name a few. And since Olivia herself owns three Shenandoah properties, she partners with many clients hoping to find second homes or investment properties in that area, often helping them navigate the nuances of the Airbnb world in addition to their home purchase itself. When she’s not hosting open houses or touring with buyers, you’re likely to find Olivia getting involved in the greater DC community through her work with Martha’s Table and SMYAL. And as the proud owner of a Bernese Mountain Dog, Rocco, Olivia is actively engaged with local dog rescue organizations, which she supports hosting various pet-friendly fundraisers throughout the year. She’s also on the board of Historic Mount Pleasant, where she resides today.", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/oliviaanddito", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/olivia.and.dito/"}, "email": "olivia.kibler@compass.com", "title": "Director of Operations | Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["3013519630", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

Ms. Lange is extremely dedicated, hands-on and proactive, and makes you feel like her top priority at all times. At the same time, she's such a genuinely nice and down-to-earth person that working with her feels like working with a friend. Beyond knowing the homes and neighborhoods of D.C., VA and Maryland like the back of her hand, she also knows all of the key players in the field (inspectors, mold removal experts, landscapers, etc) and makes all of the necessary connections. We loved working with Ms. Lange and would recommend her to anyone looking to buy, rent, or sell a home. \" - Federica ★★★★★ \" Traudel was so impressive in helping us find a home to purchase that we felt she was ideal to help us sell our existing home, and she was! Her experience and attention to detail was outstanding -- no detail or question was too small for her to attend to. She worked with other agents in a very professional manner and drew on their knowledge to help us in pricing and showing our house. She was a true pleasure to work with. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel was so wonderful to work with. She went above and beyond to help us find our new home. As my husband and I are both working full time, it was difficult for us to dedicate the time we knew was required to the best areas. Traudel completely met this need on our behalf, educated us on each step of the process, made extra time as we walked to settlement to help us walk through each paper we signed, and worked so hard to advocate on our behalf when it came to saving even after we agreed to a settlement price with the sellers. She referred us to fantastic services both for inspections, but also for floor refinishing etc. I cannot say enough go thank Traudel for the way she helped us find our new home. \" ★★★★★ \" Working with Traudel was a dream. We first heard of her because she helped a friend of mine find an amazing off-market deal and so I asked her to help my in-laws sell their house. Their house was full of stuff and she worked with them for months to get it ready to hit the market. We ended up getting multiple offers and found the exact type of buyer we were hoping for. We cannot recommend Traudel enough. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is the acme of professional knowhow -- with unheard of commitment and real respectful heart. She knows the real estate world, the real and immediate moment, and that she is working for YOU. Uncommon empathy. Listening for your true needs. Going beyond the extra mile to track all competing elements and serve really serve your best interest. I can't say enough. For real. What a wonderful real estate professional. What a wonderful human being. I met Traudel 20 years ago, bought and sold three houses with her help, and now have another true friend for life. Please ask me more directly if i can help. \" - Eileen Dunn ★★★★★ \" Traudel is a wonderful professional who brings all of her skills and charm to everything she does. We first met her in 1992 and quickly learned the difference between a realtor who merely collects the commission and one who earns it. She makes it her business to know the market, as well as what her clients want and need, and is there every step of the way to ensure that the process goes smoothly. She also fully appreciates that home buying and selling can be a very emotional process and is a wonderful partner when helping her clients navigate this side of the process. Yes, she really is too good to be true! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel helped us get our house sold during the COVID-19 pandemic and found us a perfect home in an ultra competitive market. There were so many challenges during the process that we felt like giving up, but her perseverance and patience ultimately made the impossible happen! She truly put our interests first and provided the best service in both selling our home and finding our new dream home. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel was extremely helpful in guiding us through the house buying process. She was patient and knowledgeable in explaining how things worked at each step along the way, and we are extremely happy with our home! \" ★★★★★ \" We have worked with Traudel Lange three times in the last 5 years (to buy and sell properties) and we could not recommend her higher. She has been honest and forthright with us, keeping our best interests in mind and at heart, being patient with our questions and concerns. This summer, Traudel helped us buy a beautiful house, guiding us through the uncertainties of a new build, matching the right home to our family's preferences. She is truly family to us now! We have recommend her fully to anyone interested in buying or selling their home in the greater Washington region. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is an incredible agent with years of friendships and connections in this industry. Working with some one with this level of expertise makes home buying SO much easier. She thought threw every inspection needed, every issue that the house may have (termites, radon, etc) and got every report in and everything that came in negotiated to be paid by seller. It is because of Traudel we are raising a family in a lovely home in an amazing school district without having had to mortgage our lives away! \" ★★★★★ \" The absolute best Real Estate Agent I have ever had is Traudel Lange. Traudel was very attentive to us as her clients, and with her expert understanding of the real estate market, she was able to show us homes that truly fit our needs and desires. She guided us to a place that refined what we actually wanted and needed, and eventually found us the home that fit us in an ideal way. She is very knowledgeable about the area and is incredibly well connected. And, now that we have purchased a home, we are also keeping on to Traudel as a friend. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is the best agent I’ve ever worked with. She got my home photographed and listed quickly and sold it several weeks later Furthermore, it was a complicated closing, and she not only spent a considerable amount of her own time on the closing, she brought all the right resources to bear to get the job done. I highly recommend Traudel! \" ★★★★★ \" Officially SOLD and settled on my mom's house today. Traudel Lange and her assistant, Amanda got the job done!!!! Truly professional and a pleasure to work with. They helped me every step of the way to make this a smooth and wonderful experience. Traudel made recommendations when getting the house ready to put on the market and it is evident that she knows her job as we had a contract in 5 days!!!! Highly recommend Traudel Lange at Compass Realty. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel had sold our house in Potomac some years ago when we moved out of state. Our experience with her was so impressive that there was no doubt in our minds that we would call on her again when we had to sell a condo in Chevy Chase for an ailing relative this year. Again Traudel exceeded our expectations with her in depth market knowledge and her incredible efficiency. There were a lot of additional documents that had to be executed for our sick relative and Traudel made it all look so easy. Her negotiating skills are second to none. The unit sold within three days at a price higher than we asked for! If you need a knowledgeable, reliable high energy agent, there is no better one then Traudel. \" ★★★★★ \" I moved before my house was sold, so she and her staff oversaw contractors who made repairs called for, rightly or wrongly, by inspectors. For instance, there was a joist that had cracked, and repair required coordination between the carpenters and electrician. Her staff scheduled this so that the same electrician did that work and other electrical work at a considerable saving to me. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel helped us finding and buying a home in Arlington when we moved to the US years ago and supported us now in bringing this conto to the market and selling it with great success. Traudel is an outstanding professional in the real estate business. She and her clients can rely on an exteded network, many years of experience, and last but definitely not least on her friendly and convincing personality paired with absolute reliability. We would definitely work with Traudel again, whenever we would pursue another project in the Greater Washington DC area. Thanks a lot and good luck for the future Ingrid and Peter Salminger. \" - Ingrid & Peter Salminger ★★★★★ \" Trudel Lange represented us in the sale of our home. She was a professional from the first time we met her, all the way through the process. Traudel is extremely knowledgeable, and she does a great deal of research on the comparable homes in the community to ensure that your expectations are met. Her team is fantastic, especially Justin, who helped us out several times. We highly recommend Traudel, either for selling your home or buying a new one. \" ★★★★★ \" We selected Traudel at our first meeting. She came to our home prepared, reviewed recent sales activity and the current market and discussed a plan to sell our home. She was professional throughout and her experience was invaluable. Traudel was involved in both the selling and the purchasing of our new home and her knowledge of local companies successfully assisted us with emergency snow removal, window cleaning, inspections and the best move we have ever experienced. We cannot thank her enough and highly recommend her. \" ★★★★★ \" I worked with Traudel earlier this year for the sale of my condo in Petworth, and she was extremely helpful in working with my tight schedule for showings due to my infant twins. She was also a great help in guiding me on how to best show my place and on providing recommendations on de-cluttering the space. The pictures ended up amazing thanks to her great taste. She was also a strong negotiator and helped me get the highest possible price for my place. Definitely recommend her! \" ★★★★★ \" The most important thing when working with a real estate agent is trust. We have been extremely lucky to have found Traudel Lange as our trusted real estate agent. As a European family we relocated to the US several years ago and moved back to Europe very recently. With Traudel’s excellent support we found the perfect home and we sold it when we moved back to Europe — even before it went on the market. Traudel very professionally and diligently guided us through the purchasing and selling process — always available, super-fast response times, great advice, very thorough knowledge of the Bethesda housing market, a real pleasure to work with. Thank you Traudel! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange was introduced to us in 2003 as we were moving to the DC area very first time. We knew nothing of the area, schools, neighborhoods or homes. Within days, Traudel found us the perfect home that met all of our needs. Five years later we had to sell that home due to a relocation, and again Traudel provided her utmost professionalism, support and friendship in getting our house sold (for a profit!) during a very difficult 2009 Real Estate economy. Last year we relocated back to Bethesda. We gave Traudel a tough set of criteria to work with, but she accomplished this long-distance and helped us pinpoint, view, bid and purchase our dream home within 24 hours. Traudel manages many aspects of buying and selling your home, which can often be a trying experience. We cannot speak more highly of her. She is the one to know and to get it done. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange has proven to be an expert in her field - not only once, but twice. We experienced her knowledge during the sale of my boyfriend's house and now that we are moving in together, the purchase of our new house was just as rewarding. Her pleasant and professional demeanor, eye for detail, as well as the care of the customer make it a pleasure to work with her. Traudel knows the real estate market and relentlessly perused properties that we might be interested in. There was never a wait, not a wondering what is going on with the houses we looked at. Traudel led us, with additional help from her assistant Sabine, every step of the way with expert advice. In the end, she found the \"perfect house\" for us and we would recommend her services to anyone. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange is extremely capable, reliable and professional. Traudel came with excellent recommendations. I was an absentee condo owner. She took over all aspects of this project responsibly and professionally. Her advice and recommendations were invaluable for preparing the condo for sale and the selling process. The condo closed in about a month after listing in December 2014 despite the distractions of the holiday season. I had complete confidence in her and suspect that she is one of the best (if not the best) real estate agents in Washington DC area. \" ★★★★★ \" We sold our house located at 8209 Tomlinson Ave, Bethesda, Maryland, at the end of May 2013. This was not a simple transaction: I was relocating to a new job in London at the beginning of March, my wife and I had bought a house in Ogden, Utah, to which all our possessions were being shifted, and we were selling our Bethesda house, where we had lived for 17 years, in the midst of this stressful transition. We therefore needed a Realtor whom we could implicitly trust, someone who would be available at a moment's notice to help my wife, Nancy. I was quite simply not going to be available at all for consultation or help during the process—meaning the entire burden was going to fall on my wife and underlining the need for a reliable agent who would handle the sale as though it were her own home. Traudel Lange turned out to be this person. The elements included such things as obtaining a suitable power of attorney for me before I left for London; deciding how to do the staging considering all our furniture was being moved out; preparing an attractive sales brochure; and pricing the house to sell. The results speak for themselves: Our house sold within 2 days and $20,000 above list price! The settlement was handled expertly, keeping in mind that by that date, my wife was already in Utah and I was in London. If you are looking for a consummate, caring professional to handle your house sale, it has to be Traudel Lange! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel kept a very cool head throughout our somewhat complicated negotiations with our buyer. In fact, I never had a moment's worry about whether details were being attended to - I was contacted by Traudel daily from the beginning, as she assisted in preparing my home for sale, making use of excellent marketing resources, and taking care with the myriad paperwork required. There is a reason Traudel is with Washington Fine Properties. She is a gem herself, and her commitment to her clients is proven by my own experience of a very positive outcome! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is a professional and we have total confidence in her advices. She represented us well and was very detailed in every step of the negotiation process. She is also very resourceful and recommended movers, auction houses, charities, etc. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is a very knowledge and extremely nice person in real estate business and does everything thoroughly. We have sold three properties with her as our agent, and everything went smoothly and efficiently. Nothing was missed. We recommend her for any real estate business. \" - Omkar & Angie ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange does have real knowledge of the local market and neighborhoods from all her experience, but also stays updated with information and trends always at her fingertips -- what is for sale or has sold, where, for how much. After getting to know you, she will recommend any improvements (within reason) that could be made to your home to get the best possible sales price. Then she will meet with you to set the correct price for your home given the current market. This allows her to create a successful plan to sell your home. She proceeds to market your home and generate an ongoing interest among buyers and agents, always keeping you informed along the way. She routinely follows up with them after open houses and showings. Once an offer is made, she meets with you to see if it is acceptable in light of market conditions, or a counter offer should be made. She is quite skilled at negotiating a deal and seeing it through to closing. What is so important to her is open, honest communication with you and your true satisfaction throughout the process. She is very positive, smart, thorough, lots of energy; friendly, caring and understanding as well. What a great decision to seek Traudel Lange to be my agent. She is a joy to work with who will help you sell your home! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is simply the best. If you have a demanding career and excel through hard work, you will find yourself in good company with her. In fact, you will be surprised at how far Traudel goes to offer true white-glove service. Her assistance in getting our offer accepted for a competitive listing in Chevy Chase was remarkable; we wouldn't have won without her efforts. Plus, she has the whole WFP team standing behind her, and it shows. \" ★★★★★ \" We were extremely pleased with Traudel Lange and Justin DiFranco working together as a real estate team. Traudel’s long time experience as a realtor together with her knowledge of the local market and her sense of timing, in addition to her negotiating skill, is second to none. Living out of town at the time, we depended on her’s and Justin’s assistance in getting the house ready for showing as well as taking care of the flaws the inspector found, always keeping us informed along the way. Her warm and friendly demeanor together with her thoroughness made the house sale a positive experience. We highly recommend her. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel helped us buy our first home in Bethesda, and we absolutely loved working with her. She was knowledgeable, helpful, very responsive, and a great negotiator. She successfully led us through the offer and closing processes, and everything went smoothly. We would highly recommend Traudel to anyone! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel arrived at her first meeting with us having done extensive homework on the market and our neighborhood. She researched the area and knew what to expect in terms of timing and price. Most importantly, Traudel listened to us and knew what was important to us in the sale. Clearly, that information was communicated to other realtors and reflected in the offers that were submitted to us. Our house went on the market at the right time and at the right price because of Traudel's diligence. We highly recommend her. \" ★★★★★ \" We do not have enough words to describe how impeccable her performance was in the several months we worked together. Traudel was available to us at all hours, was incredibly organized and efficient, and was tenacious in her hard work both to help us find the perfect home and then to sell our former home. Her attention to detail is unsurpassed -- she found things that needed to be addressed in our new home and helped us craft solutions with seller that were in every case to our benefit. And with respect to our former home -- she knew how to price it correctly and was able to get a higher price than we ever reasonably hoped we would obtain. And to top all of that off, she is kind, charming, lovely person who we now count as a friend. I would recommend her without reservation to anyone seeking a residential real estate professional. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel was the bright spots in my new home search! As a first-time home buyer, they explained all the details I needed to make informed decisions. They responded to any questions I had thoroughly and instantly. They dealt with a difficult lender situation and calmed any nerves the seller may have had which provided me an effortless experience! Home-buying should be fun & exciting, Traudel created a fantastic experience with their enthusiasm for the process, their professionalism, and their knowledge, all of which provided me with significant confidence in my purchase!! I would highly recommend this fantastic team to anyone!! \" ★★★★★ \" We could not be more delighted with Traudel...and that they asked us to comment on our experience. From the very beginning, the team outlined the process in detail: they provided us industry and neighborhood data (both historic and current), sketched out proposed timelines for our consideration of our listing, and gave us a comprehensive \"punch list\" of the necessary steps in order to realize our goals. The go-to-market strategy was executed flawlessly, and within a week, we had multiple offers. The negotiations between the several offers produced a material uptick to the list price, and we were very pleased with the result. Of considerable note, Traudel kept us informed and on track throughtout the settlement period...we closed on the day scheduled without a hitch. Traudel will handle your most exacting needs. Do yourself a favor and call them today! \" - Diane & Nick ★★★★★ \" We interviewed realtor agents from three different companies and decided at the end to go with Traudel Lange even though the other two offered varying discounts on the 6% agents fees. There were numerous reasons for our decision including her professionalism, warmth, and her wealth of knowledge from the many years of experience in the industry. However, the defining factor for us was her genuine appreciation of the true value of our home reflected in her suggested starting listing price which was approximately $10K and $25K above what the other two agents had quoted us. Obviously, you cannot base choosing an agent solely on who provides the highest starting listing price, but since we had not shared with Traudel what the other agents quoted us, her suggested listing price was based on how much she valued our property and the confidence she had in selling it for that price (note: for reference, the price she suggested was about $10K higher than the last home sold in our community about a year prior). The entire home selling process from start to finish was quick and smooth from advising us on how to prep the home for Open House, reviewing and advising on the multiple bids offered, negotiating with buyers (for example, adding a much needed rent back option), and being in constant communication with us every step of the way during all hours of the day via emails, phonecalls, and in person. At times, she actually went above and beyond the call of duty as she advised us also on the buying side even though we already had a buying agent. Also, she was able to refer us to a quality yet affordable handyman/painter and electrician to do some touch up work around the house. We feel a bit fortunate because this was our first experience selling a home, and what we learned is that you do get what you pay for, and even after taking into account the discounts we would have received by going with either of the other two agents we interviewed, we still came out ahead with Traudel because we ended up selling the home for almost $5K more than our initial listing price. We definitely recommend her without hesitation and because of our wonderful experience we consider her a good friend of the family. Finally, we have to mention her wonderful team including a fantastic photographer whose name I cannot recall, the team member who designed the brochure/hand out for the Open House, and last but certainly not least, her multi-talented special assistant Justin DiFranco who was an absolute pleasure to work with. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel was extremely efficient and professional and has an intimate knowledge of what it takes to sell upper-bracket homes like ours. She was able to negotiate all the details involved in the contract and closing very effectively. Given the sluggish state of the market this year, it was stressful to be a seller and Traudel and her associate Justin reacted to all situations in a calm, positive and professional manner that we believe led to the positive outcome. She provided detailed analyses and numbers on comparable listings on a regular basis to substantiate her advice on pricing as the time went on. We have no hesitation in referring Traudel and her team to anyone that has a home to sell. From our perspective, retaining Traudel's services was the best decision we made in selling our home. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel has a winning combination of skills and personal attributes. Her most overarching strengths are her professionalism and responsiveness. It is really a joy to work with someone who is organized and works hard to make the customer happy. But beyond that, she is quite smart and has great instincts. She understands the market, and will work with the buyer in the most empathic and respectful way, to forge consensus when the stresses of a real estate transaction could derail a deal. She is also a really nice person and a pleasure to be around! I am not an \"easy grader\" and I couldn't recommend any one more highly than I would recommend Traudel to you. \" ★★★★★ \" I worked with Traudel Lange to sell my Mount Pleasant single family property in the summer of 2016. Both Traudel was extremely knowledgeable throughout the process and provided great insight as to pricing the property to get the most interest and the best possible offers. Throughout the entire process they were very responsive to all of my calls and emails and made sure to answer all of my questions thoroughly and clearly. When it came time to negotiate with perspective buyers they again proved their expertise and were able to negotiate a sales price way over asking and far exceeding our expectations. They remained engaged and responsive throughout the entire process, all the way up to closing and beyond. I would highly recommend Traudel to anyone looking to buy or sell a home in the DC area. \" ★★★★★ \" To be completely honest, Traudel was absolutely amazing! This was my first time buying a home so I was hoping to find a team who could not only provide me with valuable insight on the DC market, but also a team who could relate to what I was going thru as a first time home-buyer. My expectations were met and then some. These two form a dynamic team that I believe will not disappoint any client. They have mastered the art of learning how to relate to their clients on a personal, yet professional level. What I liked best about Traudel is that she made sure you knew that it wasn't about them, it was about YOU and that they were here to give you want you wanted no matter how hard or how long it took. And they did exactly that! These two worked around the clock to get me the best deal for exactly what I was looking for. Their knowledge of the market is quite extensive and they negotiated a deal in a very competitive market that got me the house I wanted for the price I was willing to pay. More importantly, throughout the entire process I never felt like I was working with real estate agents, I felt like I was working with two people who cared about what was best for me. I will undoubtedly be using Traudel in the future when I go to sell my house and buy another one. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange and her team worked tirelessly to help us find our home in Capitol Hill and to sell our co-op in Dupont Circle. Traudel went above and beyond at every single step--taking the time in the beginning to understand what we wanted, staying in close touch with us about new listings, and working quickly and effortlessly to put together our offer. She made sure we had every advantage and gave us invaluable advice along the way to ensure that our offer was as competitive as possible. When it came time to sell our apartment, Traudel worked quickly to get our apartment ready, and made it seem like the easiest thing in the world to sell an apartment during election season, and right before the holidays. Thanks to their extraordinarily wise judgment in all matters, the apartment sold in a matter of days. We cannot recommend them highly enough--they are consummate professionals and a joy to work with. \" ★★★★★ \" Working with Traudel was definitely the best condo-shopping experience I could have asked for. She was both knowledgeable, amiable, assertive, personable, and professional. Traudel has so much experience working in DC and is one of the hardest working young professionals I've met. I admit, I had a laundry list of amenities that I wanted included in my new home, and however improbable, they found me my dream home. Not only that, we were able to go from looking to closing in 2 months (they also got me the highest sales price for selling my 1 BR coop in the history of my building, which is impressive in and of itself). In a real estate market as competitive as DC can be, it's amazing to have two people on your side that are willing to do whatever it takes to close the deal in a way that benefits both buyer and seller. I would definitely want Traudel sitting on my side of the table at closing again, and will ask them to do so when I decide to move on and up in my next home owning endeavor. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel provided detailed advice throughout the entire process from listing to settlement. This advice gave us full confidence in our negotiations with the buyers. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is extremely knowledgable and helpful about the market and the selling process. She went to great lengths to sell our unique, historic home, and brought all of the marketing expertise of her company to bear on finding the right buyer. We recommend her without any hesitation. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is a consummate professional. She came to our very first meeting with a fully-researched and polished presentation of my property and her initial sales thesis...impressive and differentiated from others I had already met. She then guided me to a pricing and timeline that was based on incredibly in-depth research. With that support I was able to to be very comfortable and confident as we listed the property and as we went through the sales process. From then on, I thought I was her only client. Every single commitment was met, if I needed to talk to her - immediate responsiveness (and if you don't already know, when you are selling your house there are those moments you need to talk). Ultimately, the proof is in the outcome. My home sold quickly and I'm happy. That's what a great real estate professional makes happen. \" ★★★★★ \" I would like to whole-heartedly recommend Ms. Lange as a realtor for anyone wanting to find their dream home. Ms. Lange combines her excellent professionalism with a personal warmth and friendliness that makes working with her an absolutely pleasure. Ms. Lange worked tirelessly to ensure my husband and I found exactly what we were looking for - which we did, thanks to her. Ms. Lange is extremely dedicated, hands-on and proactive, and makes you feel like her top priority at all times. At the same time, she's such a genuinely nice and down-to-earth person that working with her feels like working with a friend. Beyond knowing the homes and neighborhoods of D.C., VA and Maryland like the back of her hand, she also knows all of the key players in the field (inspectors, mold removal experts, landscapers, etc) and makes all of the necessary connections. We loved working with Ms. Lange and would recommend her to anyone looking to buy, rent, or sell a home. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange helped us sell one house and buy a new one within a few months. She is a true professional who listens to and understands her clients. With a great network of sources, she knows in detail local real estate markets and the pros and cons of various locations and homes. Traudel expertly organized our sale, including how to best and efficiently present our home, price it and sell it. Likewise, she guided us in identifying and evaluating what kind of house we wanted and where and in negotiating both the sale and the purchase. Above all, Traudel is easy to work with and very responsive. It is impossible to put in words how good Traudel is. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is simply the best in the business! She stuck by us for over a year to help us find the home that would meet our specific needs. Traudel is warm and caring yet an excellent negotiator--we would highly recommend her if you are looking to buy or sell a home is the DC/MD/VA area. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel has been an exceptional resource for us, without whom we would have been lost in our first home buying experience. During the search for our dream place, she was very diligent in identifying the important parameters for us. She then ran off with those to search the market diligently, and showed us a broad set of options. Her expert judgment of houses and deep knowledge of the neighborhood and real estate market were truly impressive. She found us our dream house before it was on the market! Once we decided, which happened rather quickly, she skillfully guided us through the negotiation and closing processes, which could be daunting for first time homeowners like us. She ensured that we stayed on schedule for our contractual obligations, and was always available to discuss our questions, even if that meant a late evening call for her. We felt at ease at all times, knowing that Traudel was watching our back. Her support to us did not vanish after money and keys changed hands. We extensively relied on her broad network of service providing professionals for key adjustments in and around the house. Even a year after our purchase, we do not hesitate to reach out to her for a warm, friendly advice, and every time we pick up the phone, our 2-year old daughter runs around the house in excitement, shouting \"Traudel is coming, Traudel is coming!\" \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel was so wonderful to work with. She went above and beyond to help us find our new home. As my husband and I are both working full time, it was difficult for us to dedicate the time we knew was required to search the best areas. Traudel completely met this need on our behalf, educated us on each step of the process, made extra time as we walked to settlement to help us walk through each paper we signed, and worked so hard to advocate on our behalf when it came to saving even after we agreed to a settlement price with the sellers. She referred us to fantastic services both for inspections, but also for floor refinishing etc. I cannot say enough go thank Traudel for the way she helped us find our new home. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel and her team are amongst the most professional and organized realtors in the Bethesda area. We had a great experience as she she offered us impeccable advice to us (first time sellers). Her team was really focused on the details and ensured a smooth transaction. We would always work with her - should we need any real estate help in the DC-MD-NOVA area. \" ★★★★★ \" It was clear from my first call with Traudel that she is a polished professional with a mastery of her business. From preparing my home for showing, setting pricing, working with Amanda to have my home photographed for the listing all the way through to closing on the sale of my home, Traudel’s advice and counsel was invaluable. She had a portfolio of resources to recommend when I needed them, including electrical services when I needed to replace my wired smoke detectors before closing, a roofing contractor to install a new vent covers, and movers to pack and move my furnishings. When I had issues with the buyers during the process, Traudel went the extra mile to smooth the process wherever she could, as did Amanda. The end result was a quick sale for a price that met my expectations, and a team that helped to make the process less stressful from beginning to end. For me, Traudel has set the “gold standard” for real estate professionals and the quality of her work exceeds that of others, based on feedback I’ve had from family and friends. \" ★★★★★ \" An amazing gold plated service from first meeting to post-closing and all in between. Traudel and her team leave nothing to chance and pay huge attention to detail. They go above and beyond what is normally expected of a realtor. So knowledgeable about the market and the neighborhoods and meticulous in providing all of the information necessary to decide on the pricing. A true partner along the route from Listing to Closing. Highly highly recommended. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange sold my condo in 3 days, and I made a significant profit due to her negotiation skills and expert representation. Traudel and her team prepared my unit for sale and marketed it extensively prior to listing. Working with Traudel was a fantastic experience I highly recommend her as an agent. \" ★★★★★ \" I was not an easy client to deal with. It was very difficult and emotional for my husband and me to let go of our house and sell it. And, sell it for less than what we felt it was worth. Traudel was patient with us; she listened, encouraged, advised, suggested, explained -- but most importantly, she allowed us to go through the process, and let go of our house, at our pace. Traudel is also a friend of mine, and I had been very worried that if she was my agent, this will ruin our relationship. But, she was always so professional in her interactions with us, when it came to selling our house, and I feel very fortunate to have had her as our agent. This experience has made me appreciate her even more than I did before. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel provided me with professional, diligent and timely service throughout my condo-buying process. She is always responsive, polite and reliable. She always tries to understand client's needs and think from the client's perspectives. I couldn't go through the complicated process without her. I am satisfied with my entire experiences in my condo-buying with her help. I am so glad she was my agent. I will definitely ask her again when necessity arises again. \" ★★★★★ \" We have used Traudel Lange on 3 transactions. She made each one seamless, successful, and even fun. She is ahead of all issues and actively listens to everything you want and then DELIVERS!!! Best agent around!!! \" ★★★★★ \" Officially SOLD and settled on my mom's house today. Traudel Lange and her assistant, Amanda got the job done!!!! Truly professional and a pleasure to work with. They helped me every step of the way to make this a smooth and wonderful experience. Traudel made recommendations when getting the house ready to put on the market and it is evident that she knows her job as we had a contract in 5 days!!!! Highly recommend Traudel Lange at Compass Realty. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is the best agent I’ve ever worked with. She got my home photographed and listed quickly and sold it several weeks later Furthermore, it was a complicated closing, and she not only spent a considerable amount of her own time on the closing, she brought all the right resources to bear to get the job done. I highly recommend Traudel! \" ★★★★★ \" The absolute best Real Estate Agent I have ever had is Traudel Lange. Traudel was very attentive to us as her clients, and with her expert understanding of the real estate market, she was able to show us homes that truly fit our needs and desires. She guided us to a place that refined what we actually wanted and needed, and eventually found us the home that fit us in an ideal way. She is very knowledgeable about the area and is incredibly well connected. And, now that we have purchased a home, we are also keeping on to Traudel as a friend. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel is an incredible agent with years of friendships and connections in this industry. Working with some one with this level of expertise makes home buying SO much easier. She thought threw every inspection needed, every issue that the house may have (termites, radon, etc) and got every report in and everything that came in negotiated to be paid by seller. It is because of Traudel we are raising a family in a lovely home in an amazing school district without having had to mortgage our lives away! \" ★★★★★ \" We have worked with Traudel Lange three times in the last 5 years (to buy and sell properties) and we could not recommend her higher. She has been honest and forthright with us, keeping our best interests in mind and at heart, being patient with our questions and concerns. This summer, Traudel helped us buy a beautiful house, guiding us through the uncertainties of a new build, matching the right home to our family's preferences. She is truly family to us now! We have recommend her fully to anyone interested in buying or selling their home in the greater Washington region. \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel was extremely helpful in guiding us through the house buying process. She was patient and knowledgeable in explaining how things worked at each step along the way, and we are extremely happy with our home! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange is such an organized, smart, efficient and business-savvy woman. She is an absolute pleasure to work with and always upbeat. We knew everything would work out because she quite simply had it handled. We knew to completely trust her and her incredible instincts. She makes selling a house and buying a new one somehow seem easy. We don't know how she does it, but she does it with grace and charm. Look no further — Traudel should be your agent! \" ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange is such an organized, smart, efficient and business-savvy woman. She is an absolute pleasure to work with and always upbeat.

We could not have asked for a better and a more professional team. We recommend them highly. After getting to know what our family's needs were, our tastes and our lifestyle choices, Traudel showed us only the houses that she knew held potential. We greatly appreciated having her sort through the listings for us instead of trying to show us everything out there as other realtors have done in the past. We were on a tight time frame and Traudel ensured that we moved quickly but in a determined manner through new listings. We felt as though we were her top-most priority—thank you, Traudel! Traudel was also extremely helpful in helping manage our expectations and the expectations of potential sellers in terms of working to a common goal. We never felt that Traudel was trying to push or force us into a decision one way or another. She might not have agreed with us on certain aspects of negotiating the fine points of a deal, and while she let us know gently, she had our best interests at heart. Her endless supply of granola bars kept our children humming the whole time we were house hunting, and we loved the rapport both Traudel had with our children. Our daughter even explained to us one night over dinner that \"real estate agents are the spice of life!\" Dear Traudel, thank you for all your work in helping us find the right house for us—as soon as we are unpacked, you must come by! \" ★★★★★ \" We had the strong and steady guidance of Traudel Lange behind us and beside us as we hunted for the perfect house for our family.

We have been extremely lucky to have found Traudel Lange as our trusted real estate agent. As a European family we relocated to the US several years ago and moved back to Europe very recently. With Traudel’s excellent support we found the perfect home and we sold it when we moved back to Europe — even before it went on the market. Traudel very professionally and diligently guided us through the purchasing and selling process — always available, super-fast response times, great advice, very thorough knowledge of the Bethesda housing market, a real pleasure to work with. Thank you Traudel! \" - Markus Repnik & Linda Klare ★★★★★ \" Thank you so much for undertaking to manage the sale of my residence in Chevy Chase, DC, and the purchase of my new home. I can't tell you how much it means to me to be safe, happy and remaining among familiar faces and friends just a block and a half from my former home. Downsizing was a wise decision and you helped make it so. You eagerly came to a challenge in selling/buying a home on a timeline which met my needs. From the outset in our discussions, I sensed a person of high ethical standards. I was confident wise advice would guide me through a complicated process and everything legal and financial would be properly tended. You demonstrated an impressive knowledge of multiple neighborhoods, marketing/pricing, financial intricacies, staging and the ability to present complicated real estate concepts clearly and concisely. Your patience and diligence in answering questions are unsurpassed. Return of phone calls/reply to correspondence was unfailingly prompt. You have a wonderful capacity to both listen and understand a client's wants and needs and to help the two concepts gently meet. Always there was great attention to detail from beginning to end and beyond in making sure your client and new home were the best match. You are tireless in pursuit of the best interests of your client. I always felt you were working for me, part of which was helping me see the potential buyer's view, but always leaving me knowing the decision was mine and you would see it through with me regardless. Your assurances at every step of the way meant everything to me. The real estate profession I discovered is not for sissies. Yet I found an extraordinarily astute representative of charm, grace, kindness and uncompromising determination to do the very best for her client ... and succeed you did. Traudel, you are my Realtor for Life! Bless you and thank you, Traudel Lange. \" - Ernest J. Pappajohn ★★★★★ \" Traudel Lange is a consummate professional. She gave me great service when my husband and I wanted to downsize and sell our Cleveland Park home. I followed her staging advice, and a subsequent bidding war meant the house sold in 2009 for over the asking price. When it was time to buy again in fall 2013, she helped us uncover a smaller home for sale in another walkable DC neighborhood — Tenleytown/AU, across from green space, and a block from a playground, should we ever have grandchildren. She even visited me post-sale, advising which home improvements will pay off when we (or our heirs) sell again. I recommended her to a friend, who also had a successful sale, took the proceeds and bought in expensive San Francisco. I recommend her to you. \" - Rachel Michaud ​​", "social": {"linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/traudellange/", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/traudellangeatcompass", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/traudel_lange_real_estate/?hl=en"}, "email": "traudel.lange@compass.com", "title": "Realtor/Real Estate Advisor", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2404636918", "3013048444"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3013048444"]}

I grew up locally here in Montgomery County. As a kid, life wasn't always easy. There was a time in my life where I didn't have a home to call my own. I knew I'd rather not be a victim of my hard times and circumstances and I would make it a point to give back. I enlisted in the Army Reserve at the end of high school to help pay for my education at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. I worked in finance and helped run a nonprofit that helped Veterans obtain VA benefits. Wanting to get \"out of the conference room\" I decided to move into real estate. I began helping financial planning clients and friends with their real estate needs and it turned out that I really loved it! I enjoyed how relationship centric real estate is. It's allowed me to bond with people in a way financial planning didn't. I became addicted to the impact I could have on a person's life by telling them \"you got the house!\" or \"we are under contract!\". Everyone is so grateful that it never feels like work. Real estate allows me to be with my family more than ever. Chances are you are going to see Kinley when I drop off a sign or hear my son in the background while on a call. I hope they see my desire to help others and impacts them to want to do the same. Some fun things about me… I have attended over 200 live concerts. I’m a big Washington Wizards fan. I hate pickles. I love working out-HIIT, Crossfit, Running, Basketball. I told my wife Sarah I loved her after 2 weeks of dating. I served in the Army Reserve. I have been attacked by a shark (and won't go in the ocean anymore). I lived and worked in Seattle for a few years before deciding to move back to the East coast in 2006. I love coffee. I’m super competitive in everything, especially board games.", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/layneresidentialgroup1", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/layneresidentialgroup/"}, "email": "jonathan@layneresidentialgroup.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7247665863", "2402192422"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2402192422"]}

The bad news was that Peter Locker’s guitar instructor, the man who shaped him into an accomplished classical musician, was leaving the area. The good news was that he was going to arrange an audition for Peter with Aaron Shearer, the director of the guitar department at the renowned Peabody Conservatory of Music. Naturally, Peter was thrilled. He had been studying guitar since age 11 when his late father’s guitar was handed down to him by one of his three older brothers. Now the 19-year-old faced the most important performance of his life. When the day finally came, Peter was ready. He played one piece, a study by 18th century guitarist/composer Fernando Sor. When he finished playing, Mr. Shearer walked over and struck a string with his index finger producing a sound of booming resonance that Peter had never heard from his guitar. Peter panicked. What had I missed all these years? Would it mean starting from scratch? \"Just refinement,\" Shear assured him. At the end of the audition, Mr. Shearer encouraged him to move to Baltimore for more intense study. Rising To The Challenge On many levels Peter did have to start from scratch. As a result, his appreciation for classical music grew profoundly. He initially took four lessons a week and his talents developed wonderfully. Peter learned many lessons under Shear's tutelage, but none had more impact than this: thorough knowledge and training allow intuition and emotions to flow appropriately. The actual plucking of the guitar strings reaches the highest level of musicianship only when considered with the finer details. The alignment of the body. The position of the wrist. The precise combination of fingernail and finger that touches the strings to create just the right tone. These are the greater things that separate a real musician from \"just a guitarist.\"And these are the points that struck a chord in Peter's mind. An Important Turning Point After five years of study in Baltimore, Peter came to an important realization: only a hand full of classical guitarists make it as performers and, although he was very good, a virtuoso career was probably out of his reach. Rather, Peter decided to look for an arena in which his newfound appreciation for the finer details could be melded with his sincere desire to work with others. Knowledge and intuition would be transposed to another profession. Finding His Niche Peter‘s grandfather had made his mark in the world through real estate in Manhattan and Peter had always been intrigued by that vocation. Thus, it was a natural fit for him: he was a lifelong resident of the area and he saw an opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives. Real estate, he knew, would draw on his knowledge and intuition . Today, more than 4 decades later, Peter never regrets the day he made that decision. Like Shearer did with him, Peter has been able to strike a chord with his neighbors helping them with real estate decisions – making that important difference. Still Striking Chords Peter still loves to play guitar. In fact, time away from the real estate often finds him engrossed in striking the right chordson one of his three beautiful instruments, including two handmade seven string concert guitars. \"Music is the perfect respite from my real estate career.\" he says. \"I feel very fortunate to have that balance in my life.\" Results That Sing Peter is quick to point out that while playing guitar is still a passion,he is equally passionate about his clients achieving the results they deserve. In fact, Peter views selling real estate as another art form by focusing on the right details in attaining results. \"I like to think of my clients as patrons of the arts when buying and selling real estate through me,\" jests Peter. Whether your personal real estate goals entail buying or selling, moving up or down, Peter is confident he can strike a beautiful chord in your life. And that’s music to anyone’s ears.", "social": {}, "email": "peter.locker@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2022563356", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

Months later Katie still responds immediately to my requests for referrals for service people. She’s just incredible!!! \" - Melissa, Arlington, VA ★★★★★ \" Katie Loughney is truly the best real estate agent we have ever worked with. She found us a house within our price range in a seller’s market when virtually nothing was coming on the market.

Her advice was spot on and she knew exactly what the right selling price was and how to negotiate the best price for our purchase. She was in constant communication with us and responded quickly and patiently to all our questions. Katie seems to have very good relationships with her peers, which we’re sure was helpful in negotiations. We were out of the country in the middle of the sale of our condo and she made sure everything went smoothly, which lifted a big weight off of our shoulders. Even after the sale and purchase, we have kept in touch and Katie has helped us with referrals for work in our new house. She truly cares about her clients and we are so appreciative of everything she’s done for us. We very highly recommend Katie to anyone looking to buy or sell a home! \" - Gustavo & Jill, Arlington, VA ★★★★★ \" Katie and her team are true professionals. Her calm and caring manner is just what I needed as I downsized from my home of 38 years to a two bedroom condo. With her excellent knowledge of the housing market, she guided me through every step from getting the house ready to sell, setting the right price and advising on financing. She patiently answered every question and never pressured me to make a decision. When looking a condo, she quickly assessed what I wanted and only presented me with the right options. I found exactly what I wanted the condo I purchased. Katie and her team are the BEST! \" -Antoinette, Alexandria. VA ★★★★★ \"Katie was referred to me by a good friend who said \"I wouldn't buy real estate with anyone other than Katie.\" As usual, this friend was correct in every way. Katie was always there to answer my calls, helped my husband and I navigate the difficulty of selling and buying at the same time, and went above and beyond to get our house ready for listing while we were away on vacation. She is a trusted partner and I will only refer her to anyone looking for an agent. She's not pushy, will give you her honest opinion, she's never looking for the quick sale, but for your best interest. I will only be working with her for my real estate needs in the future. She got us above asking on the home we sold (which set a record for our neighborhood) and got us the best possible deal on the home we purchased, even when we were fine with the closing costs, she still managed to save us an extra 2K!\" -Jasmine & Brian, Lorton & Great Falls, VA ★★★★★ \" Katie was absolutely wonderful to work with during our search and purchase of our first home. She was responsive, patient, and kind throughout the entire 5-month process. We confidently put our trust in her and never felt pressured in any way. Her wisdom, knowledge, and determination were invaluable as we navigated the competitive market of Northern VA. I can’t recommend her highly enough! \" - Stephanie & Matt, Falls Church, VA ★★★★★ \" I highly recommend Katie. She was extremely professional, and a very calming presence during the hectic home buying process. She always made herself available to attend showings and provided helpful information. I already referred Katie to friends and she was able to help them quickly find a great home as well. \" - Michael, Annandale, VA ★★★★★ \" If there was an option for an A+ rating we would have selected that instead of just \"A.\" Katie was such a delight to work with. We didn't know what to expect, not having purchased/ a house 25 years, but Katie made this process so easy, transparent, and successful! Questions were answered promptly and thoroughly, the process was laid out advance and updates were timely, and best of all Katie, and her assistant Liz, were upbeat, positive, and great to work with. You won't go wrong working with them! \" - Nanci & Bryan, Alexandria, VA ★★★★★ \" Katie is a consummate professional and my spouse and I had the good fortune of being referred to her through a friend. Three attributes in particular make Katie an exceptional real estate agent: she always kept our best interests in mind, which means that she never pressured us and took took her role as an impartial advisor very seriously; she was exceptionally responsive on all matters large and small, even going so far as to arrange for a member of her team to show us a new listing in very short order during her brief absence; and her calm and unflappable demeanor is downright refreshing. Stop searching and choose Katie Loughney. You'll be working with the very best in the business. \" - Brad & Miguel, Arlington, VA ★★★★★ \" Katie is an outstanding realtor. We've worked with Katie on two home purchases and a Arlington and have been consistently impressed with her professionalism, competence, and integrity. Katie provided relevant market research and guidance without ever making us feel pushed or pressured to make a particular offer. She was responsive and patient in response to our questions and moved us smoothly to closing. We recommend her enthusiastically! \" - Jen & Mike, Arlington, VA ★★★★★ \" Katie and her team were an absolute delight; the quality of their work is outstanding. Katie is truly a knowledgeable professional --- and a quiet force. She comes prepared, she provides thorough and informed answers to all of your questions, and really aims her professional advice on what is best for YOU -- not in getting the deal, like we have experienced with other realtors. We first saw Katie selling the house across our street. It was remarkable the amount of effort she and her team put into getting the house ready. In less than five days. Soon thereafter, we decided to start working with a new realtor (we had been working with our previous one years) -- having seen the standard that Katie set her clients' first-hand. We interviewed five different realtors before we made an informed decision to work with Katie. Here's why -- each of the other realtor's showed up and gave us lip service. They claimed they would find us the perfect house and sell ours at the perfectly high price. Why? Because. Trust them, they said. See, but here's where Katie was different. She showed up with spreadsheets, market analysis, sample marketing material, and an entire presentation designed around the of our unique property. Who knows how long it took her to make, but the work she did earning her MBA became apparent then. We weren't in a rush; in fact, we wanted to take it slow and make the right decision, which is difficult in this market. We looked at a few homes, and she took notes. Yes, literally, she took notes. Then she started pulling listings that she'd though we'd like -- and we told her what we liked and didn't about each listing. She listened, like really really listened. We then saw some more properties, and wham... she found one that was coming on the market in a couple of weeks. She reached out to the selling agent and was able to get us into the house to view, pre-market. She took us back time and time again that week, as we made our informed decision. We brought in contractor after contractor, literally spending countless hours there, to see if we could add the addition that we wanted. Thankfully we could and went forward with the . The purchase of our new home went off without a hitch -- thanks to Katie. And, the of our old house was so quick and easy, it is surreal that it even happened. Again, it was pre-market at an above-market price -- and again, Katie acted in our best interest, not hers. Potential buyers and sellers, I can not recommend Katie and her team highly enough. She really has set the bar at a whole new level residential real estate this market. We will gladly work with her again. \" - Carrie & Charlie, Arlington, VA ★★★★★ \"We just closed on our second house with Katie. The first time, she provided amazing service to help us sell a house, this time she helped us buy one! Katie is the ultimate professional -- walking us through every step of the process, providing excellent advice, and always with her calm, reassuring manner. We felt like we were in excellent hands every step of the way! She made the entire process smooth and uneventful. If you are looking for a Realtor, we highly recommend Katie!\" - Christine & Christian, Arlington, VA ★★★★★ \"My fiancé and I just closed on our first house and went with Katie at a recommendation from a family friend and we couldn't be more satisfied with our decision. From walking us through the entire process step by step to helping us navigate the feeding frenzy of the current market, Katie's experience and professionalism helped us secure a beautiful home. Katie showed us dozens of homes and helped us put together several offers before one was finally accepted. Her good humor and near constant availability for after-hours questions, contract writing, and last-minute showings were crucial in making the whole home-buying process as painless as it could be at a time when buying a home can be extremely stressful. Additionally, a variety of thoughtful personal touches made it clear why she's one of the most awarded realtors in the region. We would wholeheartedly recommend Katie (and her excellent team!) to anyone looking to purchase a home in the DMV area. \" - Chris & Ariel, Annandale, VA ★★★★★ \"Working with Katie was a lovely experience. Her calm demeanor and highly organized approach provided us with a very informed and pleasant experience in a market that is extremely difficult for buyers. She is incredibly responsive and thoughtful. We never once felt out of step with her. I highly recommend Katie if you are searching in the extremely competitive Alexandria market.\" - Nicole & Greg, Alexandria, VA ★★★★★ \"Like the others who left a review, my experience with Katie and her team was beyond expectations! She was highly recommended by several people in the area, and guided me through selling one home and buying another. She knows tons about all of the pieces of the buying and selling processes. I would recommend Katie Loughney to anyone and everyone!\" - Carol, Arlington, VA ★★★★★ A trusted friend highly recommended Katie Loughney, who had done a couple of transactions for him. It was an entirely justified recommendation. Katie sold my condo with multiple offers and a quick cash settlement during a stagnant market with mortgage rates hovering over 7%. Katie is an exemplary real estate professional. She understands the residential real estate market well based on her long experience in the sector and an extensive network of contacts. She is diligent in following leads. Katie is a caring person who puts the client's best interest first and foremost. She is ethical, trustworthy, and exceptionally well-organized. She and her assistant, Liz, were always available to update me and respond to questions. As a result, the sale process went smoothly, from listing to closure, with no unanticipated requests or surprises. Katie is a good marketing strategist. She has a keen sense of what will capture potential buyer's interest and how to make the property show in the best light. The few improvements Katie recommended paid off well. She also has a good eye for interior design. Together with her talented colleague, Jan, they staged the condo beautifully. It was a genuine pleasure working with Katie and her team. Besides being an exceptional realtor, Katie is an outstanding individual. I recommend her without reservation. -Tufan, Chevy Chase, MD ★★★★★ Just recently I had the fortune to work with Katie Loughney, who is the best agent I ever could have imagined. She was recommended by a close friend and is with Compass realty. When Katie and I first talked, in mid-April, I felt right away that she was the right agent for me and I did not need to look further. I told her that I was green and had not moved in a very long time. She took that into account and patiently explained everything about the process. She showed time and time again that she valued me as a client. Over the next 6 weeks she took me to numerous condos that I selected from her online database, which pulled listings from the criteria I provided and was very easy to use. The database allowed us to comment back and forth on a listing, which was extremely helpful. She always picked me up at a metro and dropped me off at a metro when we were done for the day, which I appreciated because we were going to areas and neighborhoods that I did not know. I could always tell that she understood my preferences and looked out for me to be sure I was selecting places to see that met my criteria. Whenever I had questions I always received a prompt reply. When I thought I was ready to make an offer on a place, she wanted me to be sure. I had questions, and she obtained the answers quickly. With all of the paperwork that followed, which was always available for me to review and sign electronically, she made sure to explain up front what the documents were and why they were important. When we learned the day before closing that there was a building problem that caused some damage in the condo I was purchasing, she supported me every step of the way. She had just that evening returned from vacation, yet she insisted on going to the condo to check the damage and condition. She took photographs and texted them to me to help me decide whether or not to postpone the closing. I felt that I was in the best of hands the entire time. So now that I have closed on my new home, I feel so blessed to have had Katie’s expert guidance to be sure I was making the right choice and the right decisions. I love my new home, and I’m grateful to Katie Loughney for everything she did to make it possible. She also continues to remind me that she is available if I have any questions or need any assistance. Talk about service after the sale! Our professional association has not ended. She is going to sell my long-time condo and I have every faith that she will be as determined and dedicated in that process of readying the condo and finding a buyer as she was in helping me find my new home. Team Katie! -Debbie, Washington DC & Arlington, VA ★★★★★ \"The best way to portray the experience working with Katie is to describe it as an optimized combination of being readily available as a representative, advocate, consultant, guide and real estate professional I had confidence every step of the way that she was equipping me and enabling me to make the best decisions You should not work with anyone else; rather, wait in line -- if you need to -- and work with Katie!\" -Rich, Reston and Jeffersonton, VA", "social": {}, "email": "katie.loughney@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice President | MBA | Associate Broker VA | Realtor DC/MD", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7035979943", "7032667277"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7032667277"]}

The thought of selling our condo was overwhelming -selling from out of town, pricing it competitively, legal issues with the sale of parking spaces, selling in the off season, renovation decisions, the dreaded process of interviewing contractors, and worrying that we would not be there to supervise the work. She took care of all of this and made the entire process seamless She made solid recommendations regarding pricing, timing to list and what updates would be cost effective to help sell it. She has her own contractors who did beautiful work. She kept us updated, so we always knew what was going on, always responded quickly when we had questions, listened and made time for us whenever we needed to talk. If you want an organized realtor who will work hard for you, is at the top of her game regarding worry free renovation, experienced with the market, readily - Gretchen Hempen Evelyn Lugo did absolutely a great job for my sister Mary! Mary returned to Illinois and Evelyn assisted with the remodeling and selling of her condo in Washington DC. In every conversation I had with Evelyn, I could tell she was experienced and knowledgeable of the DC market. We had many bumps along the way, but Evelyn smoothed them out and made it happen. Our confidence in Evelyn proved true. If you are buying or selling in DC, you cannot go wrong with having Evelyn and The Lugo Parker Team on your side. She makes things happen. Thank you Evelyn. My sister, myself, and our family in Illinois owe you a great deal of gratitude! -Richard Vollmer Having a realtor is part \"friend\", part \"advisor\", and a whole lot of \"life coach\"! Evelyn showed tough love, a tender heart, and a guiding hand to get the best deals for us. We have both buying and selling experiences with her and her team, so we got to see both ends of the deal. \"We initially \"found\" Evelyn the old fashioned way...calling the agent. But, wow, were we impressed. This was way more than a \"deal\" for her. It was finding the right fit for us. She was available, responsive, knowledgeable, strategic, considerate...you know, all the things one needs in a realtor (but, one rarely gets).\" Evelyn worked diligently on both of our deals, which were very different. With our first interaction, we bought a place in a \"hot\" area in DC. The transaction was seemingly straightforward, but there are always glitches. She didn't flinch through any of it. She handled each situation with aplomb and made us feel that we were getting the best value. - Michelle Catlin \"The second deal she handled was the selling of a rental we owned. The previous renters did us no favors trashing the place before they left, but Evelyn helped us find the best option. Even though our place was in a more sedate area (and far from model home condition), we found a buyer in less than three weeks. Then....the closing process. It was difficult. Negotiations took what seemed like an eternity; the buyers' mortgage was weeks behind schedule; and a client (that would be me) was always on travel. Honestly, we could not have done this without Evelyn's experience, tenacity, and fortitude. Even when she went on a previously planned vacation she managed to stay appropriately connected.\" - Justin Scott \"I put my condo on the market with very little interest shown from perspective buyers. Well I was referred to Evelyn Lugo in late I immediately switched realtors. Evelyn Lugo brought a different reality to my situation. We immediately adjusted the price of the condo, she had me get rid of some of the clusters in my unit, sent her professional photographer, and published new photos and a FABULOUS flyer. Within a day of the new posting, I had interest shown almost everyday! Evelyn is knowledgeable, approachable, personal, patient and incredibly generous with her time. She responded to my many texts and e-mail in record time. (And, I can be overwhelming at times, if I must admit so myself.) Needless to say, we went to closing within 30 days of me meeting Evelyn. I highly recommend her, and have done so.\" -Maggie V \"Evelyn is an extraordinary agent! She is here to educate, support and provide the best service. As a first time home-buyer I was very impressed and I truly knew she had my best interest in mind. Evelyn is an agent you can trust.\" -Enisa \"Evelyn represented us when we bought and when we sold. She is no nonsense and professional, and she went over all of our options with us so we could make informed decisions. She also has a huge and impressive network of professionals she works with, and she only works with the best. She was able to get us the best possible price for our condo, in part because she knew exactly what we should focus on before putting it on the market, and in part because she regularly works with contractors that she knows can get the job done.\"", "social": {}, "email": "evelyn@lugoparkerteam.com", "title": "Vice President | Managing Partner | Licensed in DC/MD/VA", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2022368629", "2024489002"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2024489002"]}

He has worked on numerous renovation projects including his Washington, DC, residence and his former winter residence in Miami Beach, Florida. He has worked with architects and developers throughout the city and sold condominium projects totaling more than 100 units. A project he sold at 1401 Q Street, NW, received a merit award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and the Washington Business Journal nominated his project for “Real Estate Deal of the Year.” He was the top individual producer at his firm for three consecutive years. In 2008, he was appointed by Mayor Adrian Fenty to serve on the Board of Real Property Assessments and Appeals. As Senior Vice President, he works with the Compass leadership and associates to increase their knowledge and understanding of residential and commercial architecture. Mr. Mahshie is the managing partner of the Mahshie Fazio Partnership. From 1981 - 2002, Mr. Mahshie held positions at the Embassy of Malta and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. He served as Counsel in the Litigation Section at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and worked as an Assistant United States Attorney in the District of Columbia.

Mr. Mahshie is a regular contributor to Traditional Building. In 2024, the partnership planned, developed, and implemented the ICAA’s “New Heights” program, conducted from April 17-19 for 25 select students from the Washington Latin Public Charter School. The program included lectures by well-known local architects, landscape architects, designers, and academics and comprised lectures, field trips, and studio exercises to help the students gain an understanding and appreciation of the classical architecture tradition. The Mahshie Fazio Partnership has also represented several developers including Dilan Homes. In March, we completed working with Dilan and architect Christian Zapatka on three new luxury residences in Georgetown. Both Messrs.

Client Testimonials Scroll down for more ★★★★★ Marga and Justine are a phenomenal team who exemplified professionalism, poise, and expertise when helping us find and secure a home we love in an incredibly competitive market. The benefit of collaborating with these two agents was evident from day one—they exude an unwavering commitment to quality communication and excellence throughout the home buying experience. We were also ecstatic to learn they offer a suite of real estate services that expand opportunities to partner with them in the future. We are grateful to them both! - Elly & Jared ★★★★★ Marga and Justine helped us buy our first home at the height of spring selling season and in an extremely competitive area! I first worked with Marga 3.5 years ago when my then fiancé and I were looking to rent our first apartment together. Marga Pirozzoli was very communicative, kind, and responsive. I knew from just a week and a half of working with her to find an apartment that she would be my realtor when my husband and I were ready to buy a house. We met Justine Pope as we began our search for houses and got to experience what an incredible team Justine and Marga are! Their expertise and dedication helped us find our dream home in Arlington and receive a ratified contract within a week of our search. Justine and Marga did everything to ensure that our needs were met and answered any questions we had throughout the process. That included constant communication, sometimes even late at night—calls, texts, emails—all to ensure that we were completely satisfied. On closing day, we were beyond satisfied—we were overjoyed! I would highly recommend Marga and Justine to anyone looking to buy or sell as they were such a pleasure to work with. We will be sending several referrals their way for years to come! - Alana & Harley ★★★★★ Marga and I have been friends for years! When I made the decision to sell our family home of 30 years I knew Marga was my go to realtor! She was very sensitive and understanding of how bittersweet it was to sell after so many years of family history and she gave very sound advice to help make the decision easier. Her professional knowledge of the marketplace and insights on timing, pricing and preparing the house for market were impeccable. Marga’s style is very methodical, practical, and organized which gave me confidence and solace every step of the way. She was able to recommend professional handymen, roofers, masonry’s, cleaners, stagers, and even muscles to move furniture when needed. Her fun, witty personality lightened the stress and added an element of fun to the whole process. Marga introduced me to Justine and we were instant friends. Justine’s warm, calm approach instantly reduced the stress level of selling the house. She too understood the difficulty of selling a family home of 30 years and was sensitive to the emotions that go along with the decision. The communication between Marga, Justine, and myself was always very clear and anything that came up throughout the process was promptly handled. Marga and Justine are a great team! They made sure every I was dotted and T crossed! Together as a team Marga and Justine go above and beyond their responsibilities as realtors. They held my hand every step of the way and it made the journey so much easier for me and it means the world to me. If you’re looking to sell your house, you can’t find a better team than Marga and Justine! - Jane R. ★★★★★ After a two-year search on our own for a weekend home (during which Marga frequently and generously shared her expertise), she agreed on short notice to take us to central Virginia to tour a house that caught our interest. Having been charmed by the house and surroundings at first sight, turns out we had only a few hours to submit a contract in a competitive bidding situation, and Marga helped us make the strongest possible offer, beating out three other parties. Once our offer was accepted, the \"fun\" of buying a small farm with an 18th-century house in a distant county began. Marga called on her extensive contacts to help arrange thorough inspections of the home and outbuildings and answer legal questions about agricultural zoning and development. At the last minute a potential deal-breaker popped up but Marga calmly talked us through our options, stayed in constant communication with the listing agent, and kept the purchase on course with an outcome that was highly beneficial to us - all over a holiday weekend. Behind the scenes, Justine arranged numerous inspections, surveys, and meetings. We wouldn't have known who to turn to for these things, and we didn't have to - Justine and Marga took care of them. Marga even came to closing with us. Her years of experience, professional network, attention to detail, and professionalism balanced with humor got us through a stressful process. We couldn't be happier with our country house or the experience of working with Marga and Justine. - Mark and Mia ★★★★★ We are repeat customers! We've sold two home sales and purchased two with Marga and her team and each time had a truly wonderful experience. While this can be a very stressful process, we felt 110% confident by partnering with her. She was candid, provided great feedback, helped explain clearly all details and managed the actual negotiations brilliantly. Her expertise and knowledge of the Northern Virginia and DC area was invaluable during our home searches. In addition, she was extremely responsive to every one of our questions, no matter how small. It was truly a pleasure working with Marga and we always felt she kept our best interests in sharp focus. - Brad & Jessica ★★★★★ We were referred to Justine and Marga by a family friend when we were living in Syracuse, New York and looking to move to the DC area. Within one day, both began sending us a number of houses from the local area that not only met all of our criteria but were in our price range. Over the next several weeks we were able to execute several offers in a highly competitive area. Eventually, with the tireless help from Justine and Marga we found a house that far exceeded all of our expectations. Our journey to finding our dream home would not have been possible without Justine. She was able to work with us seamlessly despite the physical distance between us., as well as. navigating our busy schedule with one toddler and one infant. She responded to every call, text and FaceTime without fail while always being supportive, positive and validating. This was especially apparent when in the midst of our home search and placing multiple offers, COVID-19 changed our military travel plans and placed us in quarantine in New York. Knowing that Justine was working on our behalf several states away allowed us to continue our transition to the DC area and gave us a sense of comfort in uncertain times. Words cannot express how grateful we are to have met such a power team in Justine and Marga! - Joe & Marisa ★★★★★ I was referred to Marga and Justine by a very close friend who spoke so highly of both of them. I took his recommendation and reached out to them when I began my journey to buy my first home. It was probably the best decision I made in my home buying process. Looking to buy your first home can be an intimidating and daunting task. I was so lucky to have Marga and Justine by my side from the very beginning. My journey to buy my first home in Arlington spanned just over a year. Marga and Justine were there with me every step of the way. Whether it was responding to a text late at night, drafting offers quickly and efficiently, coming up with innovative and creative ways to be competitive in a super competitive market like Arlington, or meeting with me late at night to see a unit, they always had my back. Thanks to them I was able to buy a condo that met all my criteria and was centrally located exactly where I wanted to be. I can’t thank Marga and Justine enough. I highly recommend them to my friends and family. If you’re looking to buy a home, Marga and Justine would be an amazing addition to your team. I am forever grateful for their help. - Anthony P.", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/marga_plus_justine/", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/margaplusjustine"}, "email": "margaplusjustine@compass.com", "title": "", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7035854844", "7032667277"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7032667277"]}

I realize that buying and selling a home is a monumental event in people's lives and I want to make that process as smooth, simple and stress-free as possible. I grew up in a family where building was close to home. My father worked as a manager in a building company and my mother, as an administrative assistant. I spent my teenage summers working on building sites and developing a real appreciation for what goes into a quality home – and the people that make that happen. I’ve tried to instill that same affection in my two teenage sons, but somehow they seem to be more interested in sports… Being a real estate agent marries my passion for building and people, as well as my dedication and commitment to my clients. I would love to help you buy, sell or rent a special place that will be a part of you and your ’s memories for a long time to come.

Client Testimonials Scroll down for more ★★★★★ I first heard of Craig through friends who had used his services before and who highly recommended him for his knowledge, his honesty and his sincerity. They really liked that whether you were buying or selling an expensive home or a beginner home, he wanted to help you and give you his best. They trusted him to always give good advice. When I recently decided to move to a single family home in Gainesville, Virginia from a townhouse in Alexandria, I asked Craig if he would represent me. I will always remember how gracious he was in his response and acceptance. He was honored to have my business. He knew what needed to be done to get my townhouse ready for the market and he knew who could get it done. I was able to leave so much of that in his hands. He was in constant communication with me. The townhouse was put on the market and, in less than a week, received an excellent offer that I accepted. Craig was great! I knew the house I wanted in Gainesville and Craig handled all of the communications with the seller and the logistics and just made it so much easier for me. In summary, Craig was everything I could ask for in a realtor - knowledgeable, hard-working, professional, kind and responsive. I highly recommend him. - Mary Montebello ★★★★★ We went through several realtors before we found Craig and we were really impressed by his honesty, professionalism and responsiveness. He is very quick to address any concerns or questions... even when he is out on vacation! Over the past few years, Craig has helped us buy a home and sell two other properties in DC/NOVA. He is really thorough and a great agent to have on your side during the transaction. We bought below list and sold at/above list with every transaction, and Craig often had good contract revisions we hadn’t thought of but were very happy to have included. Call Craig if you are looking for a great agent! - M. Lee ★★★★★ Craig was wonderful to work with -- very engaging and understood what we were looking for. He was incredibly helpful at guiding us through the home ownership process and very personable! - Ben Jardot ★★★★★ We are happy to give Craig Mastrangelo a great review. My wife and I had been looking for a home in the Northern Virginia area for quite some time. Craig was able to help us navigate this competitive seller’s market and put together a winning offer for our beautiful house. Craig was very professional and responsive! - Max Weitzner ★★★★★ \"Craig was a great home buying and selling partner for us 3 times in the last several years. And we always recommend him when asked by friends who are looking to buy/sell. Most recently, Craig helped us buy a house in a specific area that we wanted and did so in a very competitive market. He was responsive to our questions and was a great communicator with the people selling. Craig’s experience and network in this industry also helped because he knew the sellers, who are also real estate agents. When advising us on offer terms, Craig counseled us on the appropriate terms which made us competitive and beat out the other offers. His familiarity with the seller/realtor also made closing a easier. Shortly after buying the house, Craig advised us on selling our condo. Again, he gave us sound counsel on things to consider and do when preparing the condo for sale. With his assistance, we were able to sell our condo pretty quickly (and thankfully avoid unnecessary dual mortgage payments). Will continue to recommend him.\" - Hieu Nguyen ★★★★★ \"Craig came recommended to me from a friend who had very high standards so I knew right away I was in good hands. She did not over promise. We had a fantastic experience with Craig. We just closed on a beautiful dream home in a crazy market and managed to actually get it below list price. All along the way Craig always had our best interest in mind during times where I definitely got carried away and lost my head. We were close to agreeing to unfavorable terms had it not been for Craig’s advice and his experience. Craig is dedicated to his clients, always acts with integrity and is extremely knowledgeable in what he does. There was not a question he couldn’t answer. I could always rely on his expert judgment when evaluating potential homes to buy. Craig was very patient as we always dragged the whole family with all their different opinions to most viewings and listened to our needs and did his best to find us what we wanted and get our dream home in the end. I cannot say enough about how how much stress he took out of this process for us and even post purchase he is still helping us take care of all the things that need to be done after a home purchase. I highly recommend Craig to anyone that is looking to buy or sell a home. You’ll be in great hands. He is trustworthy and will always tell you the truth. I will be working with Craig to sell my condo next.\" - Nasila Salek ★★★★★ \"As senior citizens with health issues, we wanted a realtor who would really work for us, work around our limitations ( especially with computers! ) , and provide us with knowledgeable professionals to complete the work selling our home. From the moment we signed the contract, Craig trotted out appraisers, catalogers, painters, landscapers, repairmen, whatever we needed to sell our house at the best possible price. Craig really worked hard for us. He responded immediately, even when he was traveling for his son's baseball game. He patiently answered our questions and worked around our treatment schedules. Even after our home was listed, he did not hand us off to the \"B\" team. He saw the whole job through. He has incredible energy and work ethic. He seemed to be on top of everything at all times. We completely trust Craig's advice, professionalism and knowledge. We highly recommend him.\" - Julia Oliver ★★★★★ \"Craig has helped me buy two homes and I'm sure to use him again in the future. Very knowledgeable and always makes himself available for his clients. If you need a real estate professional, contact Craig. You will not be disappointed.\" - Christopher Ezzelle ★★★★★ \"We had the pleasure of working with Craig a second time for the sale of our rental property and the experience was just as great as the first. His recommendations about where we should focus our renovation dollars were spot on and he knows contractors for every need that may arise (even more trivial items such as repairing an ice maker). He's always prompt, has keen attention to detail, and understands the regional market. When the need arises in the future, I'll 100% do business with him again.\" - Justin Covey ★★★★★ \"Craig Mastrangelo did a fantastic job! From listing to closing, he was with us every step of the way. He is a knowledgeable, consummate professional, and a great guy. He had a deep book of contacts to get our home ready for sale, staged and show ready. His insight and advice was always spot on. Anyone who chooses Craig is working with the best! A grateful and heartfelt recommendation from us!\" - Michael MaLoon ★★★★★ \"I worked with Craig to both sell my condo and buy my new house. With the sale of my condo, he was extremely helpful in guiding me to make the changes needed to improve the staging of my home without breaking the bank. The marketing he did was very well done and definitely increased the foot traffic/interest. For the purchase of my new home, he provided expert advice on what to look for and how to structure the offer to maximize my chances to get the home in a competitive market. He was incredibly responsive day and night and kept me up to date so I always knew exactly what was happening and when. Both transactions went very smoothly, and if and when I decide to sell my new home, I'll definitely be contacting Craig!\" - Kathy Ames ★★★★★ \"There are lot of agents and online based realtor options for buyers/sellers but my wife and I without hesitation chose to go with Craig because you need trust, guidance and protections with a seasoned professional for the most important purchase/sale of your life. We have been fortunate to work with Craig two times now, he represented us as buyers on our first home and this time was listing agent for sale of our house and buyer rep for our second home. On the sale side, Craig walked us through preliminary assessments and recommendations to make our house list ready -- only suggested best ROI projects to reduce our investment costs and keep us competitive during the sale. The house listed and sold in less than 48 hours, and above list price! For the purchase of our second home, Craig gives perspectives on home condition, market value and very knowledgeable on neighborhoods and future resale-ability on every house we looked at.

Transparent. Always on your side.” Everything he does is with his client’s best interests in mind, and the result is a relationship built on trust - one that lasts long after the deal is done. Kurt focuses on guiding his clients through every stage of the real estate process, from start to finish, with a white-glove service experience that covers every detail so you have nothing to worry about. He is committed to exceeding all your expectations and adding more value than you thought possible, allowing you to focus on the most enjoyable aspects of the process. The most meaningful part of Kurt’s job is seeing your dreams become reality, and that motivates him to give his all for you every single day. Real Estate has been a central part of Kurt’s life for as long as he can remember. His family built homes for a living, so he grew up exploring construction sites and newly built homes. He moved to D.C. in 2003 to attend Georgetown University, where he received his Bachelors degree and later earned his Masters in Business Administration. Since becoming a licensed realtor Kurt has focused on treating his clients like friends and family. It is his goal to be the antithesis of the stereotypical salesman agent. You’ll never have any doubt that Kurt is on your side and always has your best interests in mind. A native of Sag Harbor, New York on the east end of Long Island, Kurt is passionate about travel and experiencing other cultures. He loves virtually any kind of physical activity, from running and hiking to playing basketball, flag football, softball, soccer and tennis. Kurt also enjoys DIY projects and is frequently tearing down and replacing something in his house, much to his wife’s dismay. A dual American and Polish citizen, he is a native English speaker, fluent in Polish and proficient in Greek. Kurt lives in Shaw with his wife, young son, and their dog – a Boston Terrier named Riley. Client Reviews ★★★★★ “Kurt is so dedicated to building business that he goes way above and beyond what other agents would typically do. As we were preparing to list our home for sale we met with other agents who made different (more expensive) recommendations for what to update in the house. Kurt’s suggestions were thoughtful, unique, and actually added value without making us spend a ton of unnecessary money. He helped us sell our home quickly and for more than any of the other agents told us we could get.” -Julia Sarnoff | Seller | Shaw ★★★★★ “There are over 3000+ realtors in the District alone, and another 40k+ when you include the greater DMV region--it's a daunting task to find one that is truly working for YOU and not just for a commission. Kurt is where your realtor search should end. He went above and beyond throughout the entire process, from helping us get ready to move out, prepare for listing, coordinating a exceptional staging company, checking in on the property every day to water plants, pull weeds, sweep the sidewalk, etc. If I didn't know better, I would think Kurt was selling his OWN house. His advertising and open houses were huge successes and despite record high interest rates, Kurt was able to get us under contract within 2 weeks of listing. This was not my first rodeo buying or selling, but Kurt was an absolute standout in the process and I could not recommend him more.” -Ben Szulanczyk | Seller | Hill East ★★★★★ “Kurt was absolutely the best agent you could hope for. I was incredibly busy, and he went above and beyond to manage many of the details that should have been mine to handle so that we could sell and close quickly. He knew the real estate laws well -- and most of all -- was always friendly!” -Nancy Barnes | Seller | Shaw See for yourself what Kurt's clients have to say on Google and Zillow .", "social": {"linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/kurtmatsa/", "instagram": "https://instagram.com/kurtmatsa/"}, "email": "kurt@kurtmatsa.com", "title": "REALTOR® | Licensed in DC, MD and VA", "agent_phone_numbers": ["3015126841", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

Who You Hire Matters, Especially in Divorce Real Estate Adding to my nearly two decades of experience and certifications, I have become a Certified Divorce Real Estate Expert (CDRE). A CDRE is a REALTOR who has passed a rigorous certification program taught by attorneys, mediators, certified mortgage professionals, real estate professionals, and judicial officers. As a crossover expert between real estate and family law, a CDRE is trained to prevent and resolve real estate disputes that may arise in family law cases. Attorneys and clients can rely on a CDRE to help resolve their cases. The Importance of Neutrality In a traditional real estate transaction involving a family, the sellers are typically one team united in their objective. When divorce is added into the mix, the sellers may not have the same end goal and may be on hostile terms. Communication is often extremely difficult. Since there are two sides to every story, neutrality becomes exceedingly important. A divorce-trained CDRE always listens to both sides, stays neutral, finds point of leverage, and creates a path to getting the house sold. This is a complex role that traditional real estate agents, lawyers, therapists, family, and friends simply are not trained to navigate.", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/tmess1010/", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/tricia.messerschmitt"}, "email": "tmess@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®, CRS, CDRE", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2023302275", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

With a degree in finance and a professional background in complex financial negotiation and deal-brokering, Kate is perfectly poised to offer her clients far more than the average real estate agent. After working with clients from countries across Africa, Asia, and Europe, she appreciates diverse cultures and works well under pressure and tight deadlines. Kate participates in local long distance running races and welcomes an invite to a 5K any day. She enjoys cooking international dishes, working out, swimming, traveling, and learning about other cultures. Kate is fluent in Russian, speaks Portuguese, and is learning Spanish. Kate’s goal is to give every client high-quality service in Washington DC, Maryland, Northern Virginia, and Delaware. A Washingtonian for over two decades, Kate owns a second home in Ocean City, MD which allows her to serve clients along the Atlantic coast in addition to her home base in DC. Kate is excited to bring her extensive knowledge about home renovation to make sure you get the most out of your sale or rental, and, if you are looking to buy, to find the home that fits your needs the best. TESTIMONIALS: ★★★★★ \"Kate is extremely dedicated, knowledgeable, responsive, a great communicator and highly professional. She is easy to work with, cares about her clients and acts in their interests. Our condo was in an up-and-coming area with a tough seller’s market. She was our 3rd realtor, and thanks to her dedication we sold! And we got two offers with Kate. To help us to sell the condo, she did a thorough research. For example, she actually visited similar properties to have a better understanding of the area and the market. She came up with a thought-through strategy, that also included some financing offers and city programs. She provided frequent updates and we revisited the strategy as needed. Can’t recommend her enough\" Natalia ★★★★★ \"I had a wonderful, trouble-free experience with Kate. She came recommended by friends and they were absolutely right. Kate took care of all the aspects related to the sale and the entire process ran smoothly. She advertised the property ahead of time inside the agency and among her network, spiking the interest of potential buyers. We had several offers before the official open house and sold above asking on the day. Everything, from moving my stuff to staging, correspondence with the title company and navigating the system as an international was taken care of with great professionalism. Yes, if you are employed by an international organization in the DMV area, Kate is the person to work with!\" - Inga ★★★★★ \"I was selling my Foggy Bottom Washington DC apartment in a remote mode (I was in Europe), and I would highly recommend Kate. She is cheerfully (yet unobtrusively) proactive and resourceful in proposing solutions which wouldn’t have occurred to you otherwise. Ideal for an inexperienced buyer or seller. For instance, she proposed to repaint and unclutter the apartment, which paid off beautifully. She also helped to fix many minor things in the property, as well as in getting rid of tech trash (massive amount in my case). She is a trusted mentor and guide in finding relevant service providers (if needed) from the first to the last step. I have not only done a long postponed sale with a good price, I enjoyed the experience and leant quite a bit in the course of it. Again, highly recommended.\" - Yevgeny ★★★★★ \"Kate is a wonderful real estate agent. She is very knowledgeable of the real estate market dynamics and helps her clients navigate very effectively through this super competitive environment. Kate is very pragmatic and offers very valuable insights and advice that go above and beyond the regular TORs for a real estate agent (she helped us with contacts of mortgage reps, insurance agents, contractors, gardeners and even gave us ideas and advice on home decoration). She is punctual, detail oriented, proactive and very resourceful.\" - Edon ★★★★★ \"When we decided to put our house in NW DC on the market, a colleague had referred to Kate. She has returned our call immediately and we set up an interview. While we had given her no information besides the house address, she has come fully prepared. A year ago we went through a sales of the house in VA experience with what turned out a terrible agent, and Kate was the total opposite at every step of the way. What was a nightmare experience in selling the house in VA was quite an easy and fun process with Kate. All in all, I highly recommend Kate. Not only she is a delightful person, she will also get the best deal for your money, whether you are buying or selling it. She had been a super successful professional in her previous carrier and she has brought that attitude and professionalism into her new business of real estate.\" - Maria ★★★★★ \"Fantastic professional service -- first to sell the house at an amazing price and with no hassle and then -- to buy a new one in a very tough market. Extremely efficient knowledgeable on a variety of important subjects and putting her knowledge to action in a non-self-imposing way: from market analytics to helping at all pre- transaction transaction and post-transaction stages. Very easy to work with and very reliable.\" -Leo ​​★★★★★ \"Kate was very helpful and caring when organizing the sale of our townhouse. She was very attentive to detail and tried her best to understand our exact needs. She consulted with her colleagues on our specific case because our home was in unusual neighborhood that had its own specifics. She made the process of the sale very clear and took a lot of burden away from our shoulders. Recommended a reliable contractor that did great job with painting the home also a great decorator who didn't charge much but made out home look attractive to the perspective buyers. Throughout the whole process she was very professional punctual and genuinely caring. I would recommend Kate to anyone looking to sell buy or rent a property in DC metro area! Thank you Kate!\" - Vee ​​★★★★★ \"I first met Kate because she sold my neighbor's house. He highly recommended her as an agent. When I hired her I had tenants in my house and Kate new all of the legal documents that needed to be produced. She found a buyer for my house before it was listed because of her networking skills. Kate is smart honest professional and knowledgeable. She was with me every step of the way no matter how often I contacted her. We have become friends. I highly recommend using her as your agent.\" - Vera ★★★★★ \"Kate helped me to sell my DC coop. A lot of work went into getting my place ready for sale. Kate worked as hard on my little co-op apartment as she would for a million dollar property. She guided me through the extensive renovations and relieving me of the hassle of being a landlord. My life is so much simpler now!\" - Esther ★★★★★ \"I had the opportunity to work with Kate over the summer when she put on the market my unit. The experience was great: Kate went out of her way to have the property ready was always available and made the process as smooth as possible. I would definitely recommend Kate to anyone selling or renting out a property.

She’s a trusted advisor, advocate, and friend all in one, stopping at nothing to ensure every buyer or seller gets the experience—and the results—that they need. Originally born in DC but raised in Alaska, Ryanna always knew she would find her way back to our nation’s capital. After receiving her bachelor’s degree from A&M University, Ryanna attended American University’s reputable graduate International Relations program, where she sharpened her problem-solving skills and aptitude for foreign affairs. In the years since graduating, Ryanna has opened a hair salon, obtained her Grant Writing certificate from Emory, aided in poverty reduction, worked in international relations, and led teams operating in the global finance space—to name just a few. Ryanna also bought her first home in DC, which ignited her passion for real estate that burns just as bright three years on. Ryanna recognizes that real estate is about so much more than buying or selling a house, it’s about finding a place to call home. To do that, you need a trusted agent by your side who’s committed to making your dreams a reality. Ryanna found that dedication in her own Realtor, and she promised herself that her clients would never have to settle for anything less. That’s a promise she’s kept ever since getting her license, guiding every client with compassion, expertise, and the drive to make a difference. Today, Ryanna is known by clients as the Realtor they can always count on. To Ryanna, every transaction is an opportunity for negotiation, and she’s not afraid to advocate for her clients’ best interests at every turn—and at any cost. As a hands-on teacher, Ryanna leverages her first-hand knowledge of the real estate process for her clients’ benefit, providing the valued understanding of what to expect along with the reassurance that they are not alone. As a DC resident, Ryanna loves getting lost in the vibrant sights and sounds of the city to help her clients find their own place there time after time. She works with clients in all price points and phases of life, although she has a particular penchant for helping first-time home buyers since she knows from experience just how rewarding it can be to make that initial investment in your future. Ryanna was selected by the US Department of State and the Institute of International Education as the 2019-2020 Gilman Alumni Scholarship Ambassador, a role that empowered her to connect with underrepresented college students, university officials, international education leaders, and congress through the power of speech. As a proud Deanwood resident, Ryanna can often be found making her community a better place, thanks in part to her work with Diplomatic Perspective, a non-profit she founded that partners with high school students to enhance their exposure to international affairs. She’s also involved with the Brookings Institute, and is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. In the rare moments when she’s not giving back to the people and places around her, Ryanna loves traveling, practicing a plant-based lifestyle, and spending time with family and friends.", "social": {"linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanna-miller-9720a184"}, "email": "ryanna.miller@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2025503128", "7032667277"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7032667277"]}

Known for her generosity of spirit, broad market knowledge and ability to see the promise in a property, she is an honest and trusted advisor in assessing and forecasting value. Sensing an opportunity to provide a broader, white glove, full-service experience, Mills co-founded MDT Real Estate (formerly The Mandy & David Team) in 2005 to better serve her growing list of buyers and sellers. The team’s ability to manage their clients’ experience through every aspect of a transaction, build upon their shared market knowledge and serve clients in every neighborhood and at every price point quickly made them a local leader. The following year Mills was approached by the upstart real estate brokerage, Compass, and her group became the brokerage’s first signed team outside of New York City. With career sales of nearly $3 Billion, MDT has been one of DC’s top producers for the past decade and is consistently recognized in the Wall Street Journal’s annual Real Trends The Thousand and Washingtonian Magazine’s Top 100 Agents. Mills is a champion of local causes, co-founding DC Wise and serving as a board member for the capacity-building non-profit, Fair Chance. She has created multiple fundraising initiatives to support her neighborhood public school, including the community-enhancing Mount Pleasant House & Garden Tour. A nationally-recognized figure in real estate, Mills has spoken on panels with industry luminaries such as Compass CEO, Robert Reffkin, and top national producers, The Jills (Miami) and Jade Mills (Beverly Hills, no relation).

No matter the space, he sees its story. Walk through a door with Trevor, and you’ll find focused intention, inviting texture, and the essential heart that makes every home one-of-a-kind – down to the very last detail. Trevor has lived the American adventure, building an intimate understanding of national market trends, regional real estate, and the particular nuance of countless home styles from coast to coast. This rich experience informs Trevor’s already keen eye to create lasting impressions and lock in striking sales. Trevor is a Swiss Army Knife of tactical real estate savvy with a skillset as diverse as his area codes. His expertise covers world-class real estate industry technology, agent training and development, team management, firm operations, and award-winning marketing strategy. When he came to the DMV, Trevor joined one of the country’s top brokers: the Leo Pareja team. He eventually grew and led the team, building up the firm’s business and elevating its market share over seven years. In January of 2017, Trevor came to Compass, where he worked to acquire the Pareja group. At Compass, he joined forces with John Eric. The rest? That’s history. Combining 26 years of experience and sales topping half a billion dollars, the John Eric + Trevor Moore team now leads the region with top-tier service and unmatched skill. Trevor enjoys every relationship he creates along his real estate journey. He’s had the joy of joining communities in the South, American West, Southwest, Pacific Northwest, and Mid-Atlantic, gaining a genuine appreciation of each unique place, its architecture, and its people firsthand. If being outside and moving is an option, Trevor is on board. The current Ironman and former state championship wrestler competes in ultramarathons and triathlons as well as playing ultimate frisbee, and flag football. He takes great joy in sharing nature with his wife and kids on camping trips. As a dad, Trevor’s favorite charities are committed to kiddos: he volunteers with Home Stretch, an organization built to empower homeless families and children on their search for permanent homes, as well as Child Help, an organization committed to victims of child abuse. He also regularly supports the American Red Cross and Feed America. Client Testimonials Scroll down for more Trevor went above and beyond helping us buy our first home! Before we met with him, my husband and I had been looking for a home for over a year and a half with no luck and we were really overwhelmed by the daunting process of home buying. That is when Trevor came highly recommended by multiple people and made our first home buying experience the absolute best it could possibly be. We appreciate how much Trevor cared to take the time to get to know us, our exact wants, our timeline, and he executed at the exact pace we felt comfortable with. He always made himself available to answer all of our questions over the phone or in person and was so easy to get along with. You absolutely want Trevor and his team to be in your corner for when you are looking to buy a home, especially in such a competitive market. We are so grateful for this experience and to start this next chapter in our dream home thanks to this wonderful team – I highly recommend them!!! - Claire and Tommy We can not say enough great things about our experience with Trevor! He was recommended to us by a good friend and he did not disappoint. We were first time home buyers and had some other friends in the market and when we compared our realtor experience, Trevor clearly went above and beyond! He always made himself at all hours of the day/night. Every house we toured he would point out technical details that were very useful to know (ie. age/quality of windows, AC unit, heating, roof, etc.). It only took a couple of houses for Trevor to really grasp exactly what we wanted and he found our perfect house. Not only did he find it, his aggressive negotiation skills got us the house and we weren’t even the highest offer. In Northern Virginia market, that says A LOT! If you are looking for a fantastic realtor that really has your best interest at heart, don’t look any further! We couldn’t be happier in our new house and we wouldn’t be here without Trevor! - Christy and Josh We had the extreme pleasure of working with this team during the purchase of our first home this past spring. I began casually looking several years before and I never felt the slightest rush while working with this team. Once it became clear that our time was near, we picked up the pace and worked directly with Trevor. He made it EASY. Even before I completely knew the entire process or was ready to pull the trigger, Trevor went to every Open House with us to help narrow down our interests (even at the drop of a hat!). When touring these homes, we were lucky to utilize Trevor’s expertise in estimating contractor costs and always gave it to us straight. It was like walking around with your very experienced brother. He had our complete trust and we genuinely enjoyed working with him at every turn. We ended up putting a total of 4 offers down on different houses. For each and every offer Trevor was highly communicative, effectively educated us on any terminology that was foreign, and made the extra effort to give us advice and go to bat for us during negotiations. Currently it’s been 6 months since our closing and we still have open lines of communication! You don’t find that everywhere. His network of other professionals is expansive and we have already utilized 3 of the connections he helped us make. We can’t wait until after COVID when we can have an official house warming party to celebrate with Trevor! – Melanie Trevor and his staff were amazing. I was completely overwhelmed by the prospect of moving. I had moved into my condo 18 years ago and had barely done anything to it, so I was very worried that I would be losing a lot of value when selling the house. All Trevor asked me to do was trust him, which I did. At times was more of a general contractor than a realtor, overseeing a kitchen renovation, 2 bathrooms and all new flooring basically “the works”. He aggressively quoted several different contractors, and I paid waaaay less than I was expecting for these upgrades. When it came time to sell my house, we listed it for about 5% higher than I expected (the renovations came out very well), yet it still sold the first weekend for OVER listing price. I CAN NOT STRESS ENOUGH how awesome Trevor and his team were. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! – Rick Working with [Trevor’s Team] was an excellent experience from our initial questions about house buying through actually buying a house. They were responsive to all of our initial questions and provided a good sounding board that allowed my partner and I to feel more comfortable with the process and to hone in on what the best situation was for us. It was never pressure about buying and focused on what made sense as they provided us information to enable us to make a choice appropriate for our family.", "social": {"linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorpmoore", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/johnandtrevor/", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/johnandtrevorteam"}, "email": "trevor.moore@compass.com", "title": "Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7039150869", "7032667277"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7032667277"]}

Although I was raised in Redlands, California, I was always drawn to our nation’s capital, a place steeped in such history and splendor. And as a self-described people person, the idea of working closely with clients to help them navigate a momentous life event like buying or selling a home was irresistible. So, after a career in Human Resources — where I learned the invaluable art of listening — and a stint as a small business owner, I decided that it was time to start living the life I had always envisioned for myself. And while my previous experiences prepared me well for the world of real estate, once I made the transition, I never looked back. Today, I’m proud to say that I turned my vision into reality. Over the past 22 years, I have built a successful real estate business that’s virtually 90% referral-based, a fact that I attribute to the enduring relationships I’ve formed here. When I first moved to the DC area, I didn’t know a single person; now, I have a community of clients that truly feels like a family, like home. I treasure my role as a trusted advisor who helps others find their place in DC just as I have found mine. Above all, I believe in creating personalized, seamless experiences for my clients that are tailored to their distinct needs and goals. I also believe that when it comes to real estate, honesty is always the best policy. Whether you’re buying your very first home or downsizing, my mission is to arm you with the knowledge you need to make the decision that’s right for you and to have some fun along the way. After all, who said real estate had to be boring? I’ve moved several times in my life — including my relocation from California — and as a Realtor, I’ve sold close to 1,000 homes to date. It is these personal and professional experiences that help me to relate to those I work with not just as clients, but as people. Real estate is, after all, a uniquely human profession, and I carry that understanding with me day in and day out. When I’m not hosting open houses and chasing down leads, I enjoy traveling, spending time with my husband and children, and getting involved in the Silver Spring community, where I call home today. I’m also known amongst friends as a wine connoisseur, and can often be found doling out advice on the perfect bottle to buy for any given occasion.", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/rhondamortensen/", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/rhondamortensen/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhonda-mortensen-8bab474/"}, "email": "rhonda.mortensen@compass.com", "title": "Vice President | Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["3013266401", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

These two are among the most kind, caring, professional and attentive real estate agents my wife and I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I believe what sets them apart from most other real estate professionals is a combination of their vision and energy. With every interaction we had, we were left with the feeling that they *absolutely* love what they do, and believe in their work. This was motivating and encouraging! We welcomed them into our home and they immediately could see the end result while we initially couldn't. At every step of the process they continually checked in on us to make sure all of our concerns were handled. The team made sure we had what we need in the home to maximize our efforts/sale. This resulted in our home selling within 24 hours!! A few weeks later they were able to get my relatives house under contract before the house went to market! The Nassar group is the real deal! We've not only gained A++ contacts within the real estate industry, but we've made friends for life. We are and will continue to recommend them to all of our friends and family.- The Fowlers \" Sam Nassar and his entire team are top-rate professionals who also really listen to their clients’ needs and goals. As a first time home buyer, I wasn't sure of when I'd be ready to start the home buying search and really needed some initial basic guidance. Sam never once pushed getting out there and buying the first chance we got, in fact he put us on a passive listing email that was tailored to our initial budget, neighborhood, and home preferences and let us come to him when the time was right and we were ready to start looking at properties. Sams amazing level of tailored service really shines once you begin searching for homes and putting down offers. From his negotiation skills to his detailed approach to assessing comps and specific properties you like, we never once felt like we were making an ill-informed buying decision. Our search began in earnest at the beginning of July, and despite the insanely competitive buying market, we had found our dream first home and closed by mid-August. This would have not been possible had it not been for Sam. He was tuned in to our wants and needs and found this property through his real estate firms aggressive buying strategy; We didn't even have it on our radar, and it ended up being the best one we had come across - hands down. An ideal neighborhood with immediate equity gains from rising comps and everything + more that we wanted. Sams service is comprehensive, holistic, and forward thinking, and he has an amazing network of professionals within the industry that he works with and it can really make a huge difference when it comes to setting you up for success with your new home.

She received her Juris Doctor degree from George Washington University Law School in 1994 and practiced law for more than a decade, holding positions as in-house counsel at an international satellite telecommunications provider and as an Associate, and then Counsel, in a prominent national law firm. Nadia’s clients included international organizations and large national and multinational corporations. Her practice focused on structuring, drafting, negotiating and executing contracts for complex transactions, usually in the technology, outsourcing or telecom sectors. Nadia purchased her first home in 1999 and that awakened her passion for real estate. After several purchases and sales of personal and investment properties, in 2005, she decided to make her passion for real estate her career and took a huge leap of faith to leave the practice of law to follow that passion. It was the best decision she’s ever made and she’s never looked back. Nadia’s real estate clients now benefit from the many skills she acquired from her legal practice, including a keen understanding of contractual documents, professional negotiating skills, and the highest level of attention to detail and client service. Ultimately, Nadia aims to arm her clients with all the necessary information to make informed decisions and is their advocate every step of the way. Nadia’s mission statement (and the key to her success) for her real estate practice is to always deliver the highest level of professional, ethical real estate services to her clients and to always keep their best interests paramount throughout the buying and/or selling process. She feels it is a true honor when someone chooses her as their Realtor, as they are placing their trust in her to help them navigate through a major life milestone that can make a significant and even transformative impact on their lives.", "social": {}, "email": "nadia@compass.com", "title": "Vice President, COMPASS", "agent_phone_numbers": ["3014664419", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

Jesse offers a personalized and seamless solution to the real estate process, customizing each client’s experience with creativity, compassion, inclusivity, and keen expertise. Jesse brings a wealth of knowledge and industry relationships to every transaction—from his extensive insight into our vibrant neighborhoods, to his background in architecture and construction. Jesse’s mission? To arm his clients with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions while advocating for their best interests to maximize the value they’re getting when it matters most. When he is not selling real estate, you can find Jesse in the Brookland NE neighborhood of DC with his husband, friends, and our two cats \"Linus and The Coconut.\" He prides himself on his gregarious and friendly nature and looks forward to being an advocate for your goals. REVIEWS: \"Since my partner and I had never owned a house before, there many aspects of buying a home that were very unclear. Jesse was incredibly helpful and patient, thoroughly walking us through the process and responding to our numerous questions. Something that I found particularly helpful was that when we would go on house visits he would volunteer a lot of helpful information and suggest things to look out for (i.e., HVAC, roof, drainage issues, asbestos, etc.). His insights were incredibly helpful. For me, as a first-time buyer, I was really glad to have retained Jesse's services as he helped me to establish a solid understanding of what to be on the lookout for when buying a new home. He also had an extensive network of contacts to whom he was able to refer us in order to undertake some minor work that we wanted for our new home. Jesse is an outstanding, top-notch real estate agent who provides full service from start to finish throughout the home-buying process. I think this could have been very problematic and potentially filled with a lot of pit falls; however, Jesse guided us step-by-step and really made it a pleasure. I would highly recommend working with Jesse, especially for first-time buyers like we were!\" ----- \"I have bought two and sold one home with Jesse, and will continue to have him be my real estate agent. Jesse is the consummate professional, approachable, and very knowledgeable about the DC real estate market, necessary qualities for a good agent in this competitive market. I would definitely (and do) recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell a home in the area.\" ---- \"Jesse is an ultra-responsive, knowledgeable champion. He guided us through the home-buying process, using his relationships and deep reservoir of DC knowledge to give us the advantage we needed to buy the house we wanted in an insane market. He dotted every i, crossed every t, and was a world-class nag when the situation warranted it. Someone wise once said that there are realtors and there are REAL-tors. I never understood that phrase, but Jesse is a walking, talking five-star home-buying experience.\" ---- \"Working with Jesse as my seller's agent was absolutely wonderful! He is organized, thoughtful, prepared, and everything you need in a Realtor. i appreciated his insights into all parts of the process and trusted his recommendations and judgment. I highly recommended working with Jesse as a buyer or seller. \" ---- \"I had an excellent experience working with Jesse. Jesse allowed me to search for a home at my own pace, without pressuring me, while continually providing me with properties that met my criteria as they popped up. Jesse’s knowledge of the DC-area market is a great asset, and he was very helpful at every step of the process. I would highly recommend working with Jesse - he was wonderful to work with as a first-time home buyer.\" ---- \"My partner and I just purchased our first house in the DMV area. We were introduced to Jesse through a former colleague of ours, and he highly recommended him. Now, we know why. Jesse's customer service is phenomenal, he knows the market, and most importantly, he tries to understand his clients. He was very patient with us, since we were first time home-buyers, and provided as much information as we needed. He goes the extra mile, and makes this stressful process as easy as possible.

By providing my clients with extensive information, numerous options, and a wide array of services, I ensure that all their needs are covered. I chose the real estate business because I love working with people and helping them through complex circumstances. I am originally from Spain and Washington DC has been my home for the past 28 years. I speak fluent Spanish and English and am proficient in French. Strengthening community ties and connecting people to one another has always being a passion of mine. I fulfill this passion in different ways. As a realtor, through the connections I make with my clients, many of whom become friends. As a volunteer, I fulfill this passion through my work with different organizations throughout the city, including the Rock Creek Conservancy, Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services, the National Cathedral School, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation among others. I have a Law degree, a Master of International and Comparative Law, and a certification in executive coaching. I started my professional career as a consultant helping European companies export their products to the USA. That experience laid the foundation upon which I then built my own company to import and distribute natural supplements. When my twin daughters were born, I decided to focus on my family, while finding opportunities to be of service to others. I worked as a substitute teacher in different schools throughout the city and became an active member of the Parents’ Association at my girls’ schools.

Client Testimonials Scroll down for more ★★★★★ \" Suzanne has been immensely helpful in our home-finding process--patiently walking us through each step of the search. She was very flexible, able to accommodate our busy schedules, providing virtual visits while the COVID pandemic initially hit and offering her valuable opinions and insights, given her background in architecture. Suzanne loves what she does as a realtor--she walked us through numerous options, suggested what could be possible to meet our needs in each particular house, and what we would need to do to make those changes happen. She also patiently guided through the process of making an offer, helping us make informed decisions and going out of her way to helping us. We highly recommend her--we hope you enjoy working with her as well! \" - Crystel & Chris ★★★★★ \" Suzanne provided excellent service throughout the entire home buying process. She provided clear instructions, explanations and had my best interest every step of the way. Suzanne was responsive to all my requests for information and dealt with issues as they arose almost immediately! I was purchasing an older home and her knowledge of this market was impressive and helpful in making decisions. Most important to me was that Suzanne was professional, knowledgeable, supportive, friendly and excited about my major life investment. I would absolutely consider Suzanne again either as a buyer or seller. \" - Carrie ★★★★★ \" Suzanne is the best in the business. Suzanne helped us sell our townhouse and purchase our single home during the start of the pandemic. She is extremely organized in helping navigate through scheduling inspections, contractors and other services that were way above and beyond. She is the most thorough Realtor I’ve seen. When our buyer fell through due to COVID the night before closing, she was able to give sound advice, help us complete our purchase transaction, and re-list our departure home quickly. We got multiple offers at the original asking price within weeks. I will also add that the Compass experience all together - from the marketing strategy to the app to Concierge - is second to none. \" - Tim & Christina ★★★★★ \" We LOVED working with Suzanne and are so grateful to her for helping us to get the perfect home for our . We hope we will be in it for a long time, but if it ever comes time to sell we would definitely use her again. Suzanne responded to all of our questions and concerns promptly and went above and beyond on multiple occasions as we conducted our search from afar due to the pandemic. She was patient, resourceful and an advocate for us. Highly recommend. \" - Anne & Jessica ★★★★★ \" My daughter moved out of state on short notice for her dream job, without time to deal with selling her small mid-century modern house. She was dreading the idea of dealing with a real estate agent by phone instead of face-to-face. She also knew that her house would be very difficult to sell without a lot of interior improvements prior to listing, and she did not know how to get that work done when she was living 200 miles away. And worst of all, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting quarantine and business shutdowns arrived just as she was ready to face the daunting task of selling her house. Selecting the right listing agent for the house turned out to be very easy. Suzanne Parmet is widely known in the real estate community for her special affinity for MCM houses and MCM style. She also had in-depth knowledge of MCM houses in my daughter's immediate neighborhood and had represented a number of sellers and buyers of MCM houses in that neighborhood. Suzanne also was a great fit for selling this house because her concierge services included acting as the project manager for the renovations that had to be done before the house could be listed. I am writing this review because I worked closely with Suzanne during the renovation process and saw what a difference she made. She was at the house almost every day as she dealt with contractors, recommended solutions when snags arose, and kept the project on track for timely completion of the work... In addition to her project management skills, Suzanne had an even greater impact on the success of the renovations through her eye for style and architectural detail. She recommended opening walls between rooms to add light and improve sight lines and flow between primary living spaces, and she even provided architectural drawings for the contractor to carry out those structural changes. She redesigned the layout of the kitchen cabinets and appliances for increased storage and workspace for the cook, and to add new breakfast bar seating. Her recommendations for... fixtures and finishes transformed a small, dark, cramped kitchen into a bright, sleek, and open modern kitchen... And she topped everything off with stylish MCM staging that made the entire house look like something from a home design show. Finally, I appreciate Suzanne's professionalism and respect for my daughter as the key person in the sale of this house.... Suzanne's discussions with my daughter about pricing the house, marketing strategy, and selection of the best offer among multiple offers received were all confidential between Suzanne and my daughter. The success of selling this house through Suzanne Parmet is best illustrated by the fact that the house had 75 showings and sold during the pandemic quarantine period in five days with 14 offers and for [significantly more than the] listing price..., and [quite significantly] ... more than the price we expected it to sell for if no renovations were made. \" - Debbie ★★★★★ \" Suzanne went above and beyond in helping us sell a mid-century modern home. She assisted with all facets including improvements, budgeting, decor, marketing, and negotiating the final offer. Highly recommend! She is very conscientious, skilled at real estate transactions, and pleasant. \" - Margaret", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/SuzanneParmetRealtor/", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/suzanneparmetrealtor/"}, "email": "suzanne.parmet@compass.com", "title": "Realtor", "agent_phone_numbers": ["3016741700", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

With booming businesses in babysitting, gardening, dog walking, and housesitting, at the age of 11 she had earned over $1,000 in one summer alone. She was reluctant to go to summer camp because she knew her market share would be diminished greatly by going to camp in the Poconos. Molly grew up in Norwalk, Connecticut, and attended the performing arts high school Interlochen Arts Academy in Traverse City, MI where she was awarded the distinguished honor of winning the Young Artist Award of 1969. She earned her B.A. at Sarah Lawrence College where she was a Rockefeller Fellow in Women’s History. Molly’s post-grad move to Washington, DC was generated by her passion for women’s equity concerns. She worked for several non-profits dealing with pay equity for women. This led to being invited to develop the first political column in a national women’s magazine and becoming the first Washington editor of GLAMOUR Magazine. That year she was highlighted as one of GLAMOUR’s 10 Women to Watch. Later, Molly went on to produce the Washington-based Charlie Rose television program. Molly honed her business acumen by owning and operating five David’s Cookie stores in the DC area. Between locating, leasing, and negotiating on all the storefronts, she discovered her passion for real estate and thus began her career in 1987. Since day one she has brought her patience, listening skills, and friendly demeanor to every transaction. She has remained a top producer and notable member of the Washington area real estate community for over three decades. Molly’s love of problem-solving, strategic planning, market knowledge, and becoming a partner with her customers – helping them find their place in the world — continues to delight her. Molly is married to Jeffrey Jay, a psychotherapist, with whom she has four children, and they live in Bethesda. She is actively involved with the giving group Many Hands, hiking, rug hooking, storytelling, and the arts community.", "social": {}, "email": "molly.peter@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice President, Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2023456942", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

An athlete by nature, Daren has found himself running in four marathons, including one on The Great Wall of China, six 200-mile relay races (yes, six), including the ultimate relay race from the timber line of Mt. Hood Oregon to the sea, “Hood to Coast”. He often (just ask his partner) says, giving credit to his mother, “As a junior in high school, my mama was finally able to purchase her first home. Through her, I saw first-hand what it means to dedicate yourself for years to a goal and never waiver until you’ve arrived. The look in her eyes when she was handed her keys for the first time is impossible to describe. This was her own personal ‘marathon’ and she just crossed the finish line.” And so, the real estate seed was planted. As an adult, Daren lived in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Austin working on various political campaigns, making the District of Columbia a natural place to eventually call home. In 1996, after working on Harvey Gantt’s 1996 Senate race in North Carolina, he moved to the District to work for the Victory Fund PAC and then at the United States Trade Representative’s Office as the Director of Scheduling. Years before Michelle Obama and the “Let’s Move” program, Daren and Dan Barlow, head trainer for Real Salt Lake City, a professional soccer team, created a boot camp called Body Recondition. Daren was the star of that boot camp for 12 years and strengthened not just other peoples’ bodies, but also his own devotion to improving lives in every career choice he has made, from politics and government to physical fitness and real estate. Daren uses his perseverance and motivational personality to pro-actively address issues before they become problems. Co-workers have joked that Daren probably runs to the top of the stairs of a four-story walk-up cheering on his clients with a bottle of water and a protein bar. When it comes to considering the emotional aspect of the buying and selling process for his clients, he always asks himself one very simple question, “How would I feel if I were in their shoes?” Daren holds a BA from Winthrop University and thinks his dog, Sadie, is just about the sweetest thing on the face of the earth.", "social": {"linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/daren-phillips-713060b"}, "email": "daren.phillips@compass.com", "title": "Realtor® | Senior Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2022575490", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

Read on for Lisa's 5- Star Reviews from Happy Clients: Scroll down for more ★★★★★ \" I am giving Lisa Resch and her Compass real estate team an A+ rating based on the outstanding job they did selling my house. Lisa and her team are incredibly easy to work with, great communicators, and developed a winning strategy for selling my home. This included: (1) having their interior designer stage the house; (2) creating floor plans; (3) creating beautiful printed and written promotional materials; (4) developing an extensive social media marketing campaign; (5) recommending contractors to paint and freshen the inside/outside of the house; (6) conducting a weekend open house; (7) managing offers; and (8) staying on top of, and communicating to me, all of the countless other details that needed to be taken care of during the process. AND, best of all - the house sold in 4 days for 1.45k over the list price. I would definitely use Lisa again, and highly recommend her.\" - Glenn M. ★★★★★ \" I worked with Lisa on both sides of my transaction (selling and then buying) and I can't recommend her and her team highly enough. She's thorough, efficient, extremely knowledgeable, an effective negotiator, and a great hand holder. No question or issue was too large or too small for her full attention. Her staging as a selling agent was impeccable and her instincts as buying agent invaluable, including pointing out pros and cons of listings and potential contract issues that I would never have thought of myself. Her team was exceptionally capable at leading me through every step from contract negotiation through closing on both transactions. I'm immensely grateful for all of their guidance. A well-deserved five stars.\" - Gail B. ★★★★★ \" We're so appreciating you for managing the of our beloved Barnaby Woods home. From the start you inspired confidence. You're creative, pragmatic, wise, and well-organized. We imagine your enthusiasm for our home and Barnaby Woods did a lot to sell it in a blink. I couldn't imagine who would come along and buy a house in December. Fortunately, we trusted you and your fine tuned instincts.\" - Nancy R. ★★★★★ \" I appreciate everything you did to make selling my condo such a breeze. I am pleased it so quickly and that wouldn’t have happened without your help prepping the place!\" - Kate A. ★★★★★ \" Lisa came highly recommended to us as we embarked on relocating from New York to Maryland. As we had no idea where exactly we wanted to settle, Lisa became our beacon and presented many properties to us over the next several months. We couldn’t have been more pleased. Lisa presented herself to us in the highest professional way. She was punctual, polite and very aware of our needs which proved to us that she was listening. Lisa did an incredible job keeping us informed every step of the way which meant no surprises and a quick easy closing on the property!\" - Dave E. ★★★★★ \" Lisa is undeniably a super-hero. Her work ethic is unparalleled and the results speak for themselves. We are delighted with the forever home property she found for us, and she our condo despite an unbelievably competitive . We highly recommend Lisa for her steadfast ability to deliver results in the most professional and down to earth approach and style.\" - Daniel T. ★★★★★ \" Lisa is remarkable. We could not have downsized (happily) without her. Lisa recommended pre- improvements for our old place, found a contractor, advised on construction, surveyed her colleagues on pricing, and helped us identify out-of-town buyers that fit the house and our timeline for moving out. Once our contract was accepted, she ramped up negotiations with a developer nearing completion on a place in our target neighborhood. Lisa handled detailed negotiations on finishings, all while helping us find a mortgage broker willing to meet our deadline. From start to finish, Lisa was generous, wise, poised, patient, and 100% on our side.\" - Jim D. ★★★★★ \" Lisa was an amazing realtor! I wasn’t even sure if — given COVID — it was a good time to list my DC rental property. But a friend had strongly recommended her, so I called Lisa just to see what she thought. I loved her immediately — such a great combination of warm energy and knowledge. Flash forward six weeks later — my house , after ONE Open House, $35k over the asking price with no contingencies! Best of all, I really had to do nothing — Lisa did the staging, dealt with my tenants, my property manager, the title companies, and even engaged the landscaper who improved the house’s curb appeal. Such a pleasure to work with Lisa — I recommend her without reservation!\" - Valerie P. ★★★★★ \" Lisa is a true professional and a dream to work with. She's kind, responsive, pleasant and knows real estate in and out. I look forward to working with you again soon!\" - Koki A. ★★★★★ \" First rate! Attentive. Astute. Hardworking. Straight shooter. Best of all, my condo within days of its being posted on MLS-- and at full price. The place I purchased through Lisa suits us perfectly. And, it has already appreciated!\" - James N. ★★★★★ \" Lisa was unbelievably knowledgeable, helpful and supportive throughout our home buying process! Even after we closed, she continued to check in to make sure everything was okay. She is a consummate professional and we loved working with her.\" - Danielle A. ★★★★★ \" Lisa was a joy to work with. She was responsive and on top of everything. She helped us sell our house in no time for more than the asking price. She managed everything from start to finish - we could not have had a better experience!\" - Amanda F. ★★★★★ \" Lisa is the best! She was incredibly res[ponsive and knowledgeable about the when helping us buy our new home. She took the time to really get to know what we needed. I would absolutely recommend her.\" - Jessica T. ★★★★★ \" Lisa was a consummate professional - highly responsive, knowledgeable and upbeat. A pleasure to work with. Highly recommended.\" - John R. ★★★★★ \" Lisa is the absolute tops. She helped us sell two condos in downtown DC and did so with great professionalism and brought home winning bids. I can't recommend Lisa highly enough!\" - Tom K. ★★★★★ \" Steven and I have bought and sold four homes together. All of our experiences have been positive, but this was the best. Lisa was creative, smart, patient and kind. She also suggested that we feature our house as coming soon without putting it… on the market given our time frame. It worked out brilliantly. She was recommended to me by a friend with a similarly strong experience. I hope I'm not selling the next house any time soon, but if I were I would choose her again.\" - Nancy", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/lisaresch.realtor/"}, "email": "lisa.resch@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2022369527", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

Late one Saturday evening, I received a seemingly impossible request: a visit to Great Point, the island's northernmost tip, with an old iconic lighthouse, surrounded by a wild refuge of seals. Truly a must see! This would require a 3-hour round-trip, driving down a soft, 7-mile beach—a challenge not to get stuck, compounded by finding a driver and 4x4 vehicle on a Sunday morning, and a tight schedule that demanded the client return by 12:30pm to catch a taxi to the airport. With no availability of staff to spare the next morning, I offered to take the client. Having driven there the previous summer, I knew the route well. By 9am, I secured a jeep and we were on our way. The client was awestruck by the sight of the white, iconic lighthouse. We then turned the bend and gasped at the spectacle of hundreds of seals basking on the beach. Then unexpectedly, a large group of seals descended into the ocean and turned to swim towards us. The client was elated and cried out “Oh my goodness, did you plan this?”. We returned to the hotel just in time for the client to catch her taxi. As she waved goodbye she yelled “Next year I’m coming back with my family. Thank you!” “ The key is to set realistic customer expectations and then not to just meet them, but to exceed them — preferably in unexpected and helpful ways. ” – Sir Richard Branson Service \" Customer needs may vary, but their bias for quality never does\" - Bill Marriott, Marriott International With over 15 years in luxury hospitality, I’ve cultivated an unwavering commitment to excellence, discretion, and the art of exceptional service.

From there, they helped us write a competitive offer that kept us below our desired price point and with less out of pocket to close. He kept us informed about each deliverable every step of the way. And, even when the seller had things in jeopardy on the day of closing, they created an alternative strategy that morning to ensure we made it to the finish line.” - Dan & Liz ★★★★★ \"We had the pleasure of working with Miguel in both selling our townhouse and purchasing our new home. From day 1, they had clear and open communication with us on what to expect from both the selling and buying side. They provided a step-by-step playbook of the process which helped alleviate our stress and constantly kept us in the loop. Not only were they extremely knowledgeable, but they were always available to advise, answer questions, and guide us through the entire sales cycle. They turned what is a typically stressful journey into a seamless and enjoyable experience.

Not only does he know his stuff he has great resources as well! He is a great negotiator and made sure we got the most out of price and inspections on both homes (selling of our previous home and purchase of our forever home).

The whole process of selling and buying was so seamless and I seriously could not recommend him more.” - Nick & Kate C ★★★★★ ”Miguel is truly amazing!

Prior to putting our house on the market he gave us reasonable recommendations to increase our sales price and walked us through each and every step. Due to his marketing strategies our house had a on it the first day it was placed on the market. Miguel kept us the loop up to the day we went to settlement on every part of the inspections and appraisal processes. He kept in constant communication with us, which was very reassuring.

As first-time single-family home buyers, he was responsive to all of our needs. He walked us through the financing, inspection, and negotiated closing cost credit and seller repairs. He hooked us up with a contractor to refinish our and entertained our two--old during our closing. We would highly recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell in the DMV!\" - Hally ★★★★★ \"We have worked with Scott for our home Kalorama, and now out home purchase Reston. We have felt very comfortable working with Scott for the last two years. He is obviously knowledgeable as well as very professional. I would (and do) highly recommend him to anyone who is in need of a real estate agent.\" - James ★★★★★ \"Scott really went above and beyond helping us buy our new home. He is extremely knowledgeable about DC properties, the quirks and expectations of older homes and what properties are worth the investment. I never once questioned Scott's opinions or explanations - he knows his stuff! Over countless showings and a number of fruitless offers made, he remained persistent and by our side. Not only that, but Scott worked over Thanksgiving day while writing the offer and negotiating the of our (now) home. When we needed some repairs prior to closing, Scott set everything up for us, securing the GC and overseeing the work. He stopped by the property multiple times between the time our offer was accepted and closing day -- just to offer additional assurances that when we got our keys, no surprises would be in store. I 10000% recommend Scott Sachs!\" ★★★★★ \"Scott's experience and patience were invaluable in our yearlong search as first time home buyers. He had great advice, listened to our many questions and feedback, and helped us find the perfect fit. He's quick to respond and knows the market extremely well (we shopped in DC, MD and NoVa). We went with one of his contractor recommendations for a paint job as well. Very happy in our new home!\"", "social": {"youtube": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4puBin-20-hnKt5Z4x0u6A", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/ScottSellsDC/", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/sachssells/"}, "email": "scott.sachs@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["3019084373", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

Prior to his official transition into real estate, Dito ran his eponymous award-winning, iconic DC bar for 15 years, where he leveraged his service-driven outlook and problem-solving skills to create memorable experiences for every patron who walked through his doors. And although Dito thrived in the field of hospitality, he was always drawn back to real estate, to his longtime passion for guiding others through the complex and pivotal process of buying or selling a home. Today, Dito and Olivia are devoted Realtors, empowering clients all over the DC area to find the perfect home or the right buyer. Dito is best known first-time buyers and seasoned sellers alike for his tireless work ethic, transparent approach, and meticulous attention to even the smallest of details. Whether it’s the way the sunlight streams in, the historic tiling in the bathroom, or the spot in the corner eagerly awaiting a certain succulent, Dito recognizes that it’s these seemingly insignificant features of a home that allow someone to envision building a life there. Dito also has the unique ability to see every transaction through the eyes of the client, taking the time to understand their hopes and preferences before translating them into reality. Born and raised in Washington, DC, Dito offers an encyclopedic knowledge of the city, and loves helping his clients discover all of its nuanced charm—from the bustling streets of Downtown, to the verdant sidewalks of Cleveland Park and beyond. He partners with clients at every price point and never shies away from a challenge, working to break down the mental and physical barriers that might normally prevent someone from reaching their home buying or selling goals. He’s also a savvy marketer, consistently employing the right strategy to best position each for maximum appeal and exposure. Thanks to Dito’s extensive local roots and gregarious personality, it’s no surprise that he has cultivated a vast referral network over the years, one that he attributes to the lasting connections he’s made here. For Dito, real estate has never been about simply closing the sale, but rather the lives he’s helped to shape and the meaningful relationships he’s formed along the way. Above all, Dito’s mission is to manage the entire search or sale process seamlessly, finding creative solutions to every roadblock while ensuring his clients are comfortable and confident in what their future holds. Dito is all too familiar with the stress that can often accompany a transformative life decision like buying or selling a home, which is why he strives to alleviate some of that emotional intensity with his storied sense of humor and commitment to finding the fun in any situation.", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/oliviaanddito", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/olivia.and.dito/"}, "email": "dito.sevilla@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2025492491", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

I love what I do & these days you can find me practicing my craft at Compass in the DMV. Even after spending years working in the New York City real estate market, I must admit that the DMV is as challenging and enervating a place to be a realtor as is the Big Apple. After graduating from New York University with a BA in Political Science and History and completing my graduate studies at Columbia University, I pursued careers in the advertising industry and in medical administration. And then my lifelong fascination with real estate prevailed and I started a real estate development company concentrating on single family properties in upscale markets in New York. This experience, combined with my years as a sales agent focusing on all aspects of the market including multi-unit developments in Manhattan, has provided me with a depth of experience and understanding that form the basis of the way I've been practicing my profession for these last 15 years here in the DMV. Knowing the nuances of both the market and my clients' needs forms the framework of all interactions with and for my clients, be they buyers, sellers, developers or investors. I view each client's needs in relation to their individual long and short term financial and lifestyle goals offering an integrated approach to each transaction. As an admitted workaholic I’m available by cell from 7:00am-11:00pm, text and email 24/7. I pride myself on being a rapid responder so If you don't hear back from me quickly, I'm probably out walking my latest rescue baby, a now 5 year -old Black Lab mix ,Evan or rather Evan is probably walking me! I’m an avid supporter of Animal Rights Rescue Groups, HRC, equal rights for all and…the beach, books and film! I'm proud to have been a member of the DCAR (District of Columbia Association of Realtors) Public Policy Committee for 12 years, as well as a member of the Affordable Housing subcommittee.

With selling, he helped me stage my place and came up with an excellent and comprehensive “out of the gate” strategy that helped me elicit multiple offers and close quickly. With buying, he was on top of new listings, some even before they hit the market, and provided options and insights – plus lots of patience – which helped me find my new home.\" - Dave, Observatory Circle (seller) and Columbia Heights (buyer) “I have used David Shotwell in my last two real estate transactions, the first for the sale of an attached row home in Columbia Heights, and the second, a condo in Dupont Circle. In both instances David was very knowledgeable of the local market as well as my specific properties versus the comparable inventory. This allowed us to develop an appropriate pricing strategy which David was extremely knowledgeable in both explaining and executing. In both instances we received multiple offers over the asking price and both transactions were closed short order with minimal stress my part. His team was more than competent in the coordination of the closing process, again eliminating for stress me. I would definitely recommend David and his team for any real estate transaction. And now that I have sold my two places, I will using him again shortly to purchase my next home.” - Frank, Dupont Circle (seller) and Columbia Heights (seller) \"As a first-time buyer, I was looking an agent the industry intelligence, appreciation of my best interests and patience to walk me through the process from start to finish – and David encompassed all of that and more. Anyone will realize after chatting with him for a couple of minutes that David’s charm stems from a genuine desire to make sure that his client is happy - and that is hugely important when making this kind of milestone decision. I can't imagine going through the buying process without an agent like David who pointed out new opportunities, calmly explained lengthy loan documents, patiently listened to my concerns and provided thoughtful, intelligent and actionable feedback. My buying process was well-planned, swift and without stress, primarily due David’s diligent follow-up with all parties, his consideration of my needs and concerns, and his funny and lighthearted company throughout the entire process.

His subsequent streamlined research proved to be highly productive with us finding our home in less than two weeks! His due diligence made the process seamless and productive. \" - Tenzin and Tashi ★★★★★ \" We’ve worked with no one more diligent than Brian Siebel.

He was able to help us both sell our previous home and buy our current home all within the same month! It was a tight turn, but he helped guide us through to a successful completion.

Brian was incredibly patient with us as we continued to explore northern Virginia and adjust to the realities of buying a home in a very competitive market. No matter how busy he was, we always felt like his number one client. When it was time to put in an offer, he very clearly walked us through the process so that we understood everything – it was truly a great learning experience. You will not find a more attentive agent – more than six months after closing, my wife texted Brian with a question and he responded same day. That truly sums up our experience with Brian.

I could not be more pleased. \" - Jim ★★★★★ \" I highly recommend those interested in buying/selling a home in Northern Virginia to use Brian Siebel. After years of renting apartments in the DC and Virginia area my wife and I decided we were ready to purchase our first home. We were recommended to use Brian from our mortgage and it turned out great. As first time homebuyers we were very unsure of the process. Brian was extremely patient with us and took the time to explain everything we needed to know. Further, Brian showed us several homes for and provided honest feedback. We never felt pressured Brian to make a decision; rather he suggested we take the time we need to make our decision. When it was time to make an offer Brian was very prepared and worked with us to structure an offer for our new home. I highly recommend Brian and look forward to working with him in the future. \" - Andrew and Jane", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/RealEstatebyBrianSiebel/", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/SiebelHomes/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/briansiebel", "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/realtorbriansiebel/"}, "email": "brian.siebel@compass.com", "title": "Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7038510979", "7032667277"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7032667277"]}

It represents a commitment to work with clients who aspire to simplify their lives by choosing walkable neighborhoods or those just a short drive to vibrant city centers where great food, entertainment, and community engagement are readily available. Sam's clientele shares his belief that shorter commutes, and less driving in general, helps to cultivate a happy home where the surrounding community is an extension of the family residence. In 2015 Sam was the #1 producing agent at his prior firm's Chevy Chase office of 100+ agents, Sam's individual annual production reached $25M in the years before he moved to Compass. In the Fall of 2017, Sam accepted a position as Vice President at Compass, which is now the #1 brokerage by sales volume in the DC market. Compass is leading the way by providing cutting edge technology and services to their agents, buyers and sellers. Sam's Compass volume regularly averages between $20M and $30M per year. In 2019, Sam launched The Solovey Group at Compass and brought on seasoned agents Orysia Stanchak, Jon Solovey and Mary Zitello who each have long and successful track records in real estate. Sam works with clients at all life stages but especially enjoys first and second time buyers and sellers as well as those down-sizing from the house where they have lived many years. He also carves out time to work with investors who wish to expand their portfolio. Licensed in DC, MD, VA, and DE, Sam serves all facets of the home buying and selling process across the entire DC Metro region as well as the sought after beach towns of Rehoboth and Lewes, Delaware. Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \" Sam was tremendous. We are first-time homebuyers and had a lot to learn about pretty much everything relating to home buying and ownership. There was no question or issue too small for Sam's full attention, and we knew right from our first interaction that he was someone who cares deeply about the people he's helping, not just making a sale. Our search lasted roughly three months and Sam's guidance was crucial during every phase of the search. Whether it was in formulating our priorities, digging deeper on property details, or final negotiations, Sam was always willing and able to provide all the information needed for us to make decisions. He would regularly say that these decisions were ours, but his emails were usually so thorough that we'd have been crazy not to follow his advice. This attention to detail did not wane even during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we would not have blamed Sam if it did! Ultimately, we are happy in our new home but we did have a tinge of regret after purchase knowing that we'd no longer get to work with Sam. \" ★★★★★ \" I enjoyed and appreciated working with Sam. Sam is smart, direct and honest. He thinks creatively about how to achieve the outcome one is looking for, and he has excellent resources to call upon. I also liked that Sam is very responsive to all forms of communication. The sale of our house was drama free, and Sam guided us smoothly through the process. Everything and more than we expected or hoped for! \" ★★★★★ \" We had an absolutely fantastic experience working with Sam to sell our condo. As a family with young kids, we were concerned about how time consuming the process would be. Sam took care of absolutely everything, from staging and getting the unit ready to helping us get the paperwork filled in via email and online platforms, and negotiating the best deal – he made it simple, efficient and quick. We couldn’t have asked for more, not to mention the great sale price. \"", "social": {"linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-solovey-0a654b99", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/SamSoloveyRealEstate/"}, "email": "sams@compass.com", "title": "Vice President | Realtor® Licensed in DC, MD, VA & DE", "agent_phone_numbers": ["3014043280", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

As a founding Agent of Compass DC, she’s well equipped with the experience and knowledge to provide the best service. While maintaining core values that transfer universally, she tailors each transaction to best obtain her clients’ goals. After receiving a B.A. in Communications from the University of Texas at San Antonio, Kendall moved to Washington, DC, and immersed herself in the community. Her decision to enter residential real estate came partly from her love of DC homes, design and decorating, and also from her previous experience in Commercial Real Estate Development. Early in her career, she began by purchasing, renovating, and selling investment properties. She then moved to longer-term holds, by purchasing several investment properties where she focused on high-end, historic row homes within walking distance to DC’s prime sightseeing locations. Within weeks of launching and forming a team to manage the properties, they were all ranked in the 99th percentile on VRBO and Airbnb. Kendall attributes a lot of her success to her knowledge of the market and the individual neighborhoods that make up the DMV, her ability to extend exceptional customer service and her genuine enthusiasm for real estate.

A great experience all the way around.\" ★★★★★ \"We were incredibly grateful to leverage Laura's sharp market insights, extensive industry connections, and strong negotiating skills for two home purchases and a home sale in Maryland and DC. In addition to being an experienced and savvy agent, Laura is extremely warm and compassionate. She connects with her clients on a personal level, truly cared about meeting our family's needs, and makes the experience enjoyable and exciting.\" ★★★★★ \" We absolutely LOVED working with Laura. She held true to a \"no-pressure\" approach and was such a wonderful listener. We always felt that she had our wants and needs at the forefront of her mind throughout the process. Laura helped us sell our home - working with us to showcase it in such a way that resulted in a bidding war and then a contract just 48 hours after we went to market! We were impressed with Laura's negotiation savvy and delighted that she reached a deal that was above our asking price. Laura also helped us find our new home on our dream street. We thought it was impossible, but Laura went above and beyond to make it a reality for us. She was, again, excellent at negotiating this transaction as well. We are still so thankful to her for her help and expertise with this process to this day! We couldn't have asked for a more responsive, attentive, and dedicated agent. She made what was a complicated and emotional process one that was easy and enjoyable - thanks to her hard work and because of who she is.

We cannot recommend her highly enough! \" ★★★★★ \" Laura has sold a house for us and was also our agent for the purchase of our new home. She had clearly done her research on our submarket and she carefully priced the sale of our home. Her efforts were well planned and resulted in a bidding war, and ultimately in the sale of our home at a price above our asking price. On the purchase, Laura was realistic, but aggressive and was creative in crafting a unique offer that met our goals. On a more personal note, Laura was a pleasure to work with. She truly listened to us and focused on what was most important to us. She was knowledgeable and comforting during what could be a highly stressful time. I highly recommend Laura! Whether you are buying or selling, you will not be disappointed with Laura. She is a very hard-working, smart, creative, and fun person. \" ★★★★★ \"Laura was a pleasure to work with during our house hunt and did an excellent job walking us through the home-buying process. She has a great understanding of the neighborhoods in the NW DC area and can give you an excellent indication of what true home values are throughout the area. She took the time to gain an understanding of exactly what type of house we were looking for at the start of our search. Laura also has great recommendations for home inspectors and mortgage brokers to facilitate the closing process.\" ★★★★★ \" I've had the privilege of working with Laura on two separate occasions - as a buyer and most recently as a seller. Both experiences were flawless and easy! Laura and her staff walked me through every step of the process, were available to answer any and all of my questions, and worked hard to get the job done. In fact, Laura was on vacation with her family when I purchased my current home! Despite being thousands of miles away, she managed to pull together a winning contract. I'm certain that without her knowledge and expertise, it never would have happened. I would recommend Laura Steuart to anyone looking for an agent without hesitation! \" ★★★★★ \"Laura assisted us with the purchase of our home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. There were several other offers in play and it was Laura’s sharp skills that secured the contract for us. Laura understands the MD/VA/DC area real estate market, is knowledgeable about the neighborhoods, and takes the time to understand her clients and what they are seeking in a home.

Both of Keene's parents were in the business, founding an independent residential brokerage, Taylor Real Estate, in the late 1970's. After graduating from Rice University with a BS in Electrical Engineering, Keene worked for more than 6 years doing technical consulting work for Booz Allen Hamilton before joining the family business in late 1989. While with TRE, Keene was the firm's Property Manager and then Sales Manager, learning all aspects of the local D.C. market. In 1996 Keene formed a partnership with his brother-in-law, Steve Agostino, and purchased TRE from his parents, becoming the 's Principal Broker. Keene and Steve grew TRE, Inc. into a significant player in the close-in Metro market, eventually reaching about 30 agents in size. During this time Keene sat on the Board of Directors of both the local (GCAAR) and national (NAR) real estate associations, and he was also privileged to serve as President of the D.C. Association of Realtors in 2003. Keene and Steve also expanded the company's property business, eventually splitting that operation into a separate entity, Taylor Properties Ltd. In early 2003, they the sales brokerage business to the largest independent brokerage in the mid-Atlantic region. At this point, Keene and Steve formed a powerful sales team with his parents, who they worked with until Keene Sr's death in 2008. Since then, Keene has continued to work with Steve and his mother, Nancy Taylor, as the Taylor Agostino Group (TAG). TAG is proud to have made the move to Compass in early 2017, to take advantage of the cutting edge technology and forward thinking vision of this rapidly growing real estate company. Compass' data-driven tools and expert, top-shelf marketing help Keene serve both his buyer and seller clients at the highest level. Client Testimonials ★★★★★ Keene Taylor is a real estate agent par excellence—strategic, dedicated, caring, and immensely effective. After seeing Keene actively engage in showing us the intricate merits of a condo he was showing—a welcome change from most agents who just stand in the corner while you walk around – we hired Keene to help us find a new home and sell ours. Keene then faced the challenge of positioning our 135-year-old home, charming but showing its age, for the best possible sales price. He sought input from other agents and carefully set an optimal pricing strategy. Keene is an all-round great guy and amazing real estate agent. You can’t do better. Mary and Peter Robinson ★★★★★ We worked with Keene after running into him at an open house. We wanted to work with someone who was an expert in NW DC and Bethesda. In our first conversation it was clear that he was going to provide great customer service, leave no stone unturned, and keep us in the loop every step of the way. Keene demonstrated genuine empathy towards us at all stages of the process. We never felt rushed and although we knew it wasn’t the case, we felt like we were his only clients. He demonstrated contagious optimism, experience, and patience. Finally, it was clear Keene is honest and acts with integrity. His reputation and strong relationships with other realtors in the area can give you an edge in an extremely competitive market. We are now his biggest cheerleaders and we plan to refer him to anyone who is looking for a realtor. Dan C. and Jessica M. ★★★★★ Keene, now that the dust has settled from the big move away from Washington (425+ boxes unpacked!), I wanted to thank you for all the work you did-the time, the attention to detail and negotiation advice-to bring us such an excellent result. Please give our thanks as well to Kathy and the team-all are much appreciated! It was painfully hard to leave that house, but we are, at the same time, genuinely excited about the next chapter in our new home! And a pool is rather nice! I hope we can join forces again when we (inevitably) move back to DC! Until then, we wish you all the best.

Our online lifestyle publication provides fantastic articles and features covering the Washington, DC region and much more! Each issue is chock full information and great reads. It contains everything that you need to know and more. Scroll down to hear from our clients. I cannot stress enough what a pleasure it was to work with Trevor and the entire John Eric + Trevor Moore Team. This team is comprised of knowledgeable and experienced professionals. My condo sold within one day of listing and at list price. If you use Trevor as your listing agent, I guarantee a great sale. Smooth and rapid communication and explanations. Terrific advice and support from the first minute to the close date. Ease of mind regarding renovations and other repairs (not only did he plan and execute a kitchen renovation – which netted a much higher profit – he also oversaw other repairs from general wear and tear.) A calm, guiding hand in negotiations. Honestly, there is no better agent to have on your side than Trevor Moore. And Janis from the JE + TM Team was both extremely timely and friendly when helping with the transaction. Through the entire process, I felt incredibly positive and comfortable when working with this team – Bridget C. John Eric has a proven strategy for selling your house quickly and for the greatest return. The superb John Eric + Trevor Moore team can seamlessly handle every aspect of your move (or as much as you need them to), from pre-planning the sale through to the final close. And with the Compass Concierge program, any owner can quickly present their home in the best possible light. So just shut up now and do what he says! You'll be glad you did! – Bruce W. Be prepared to be wowed. We weren’t prepared. But, boy were we wowed. In the run up to prepare for selling our house, we invited a couple of agents to present to us. From our first encounter, John distinguished himself as a business professional with a business plan. A strategic analysis, supported by a lineup of tactics to accomplish each objective, separated John from his peers. John did his homework. He came prepared with an analysis of the neighborhood, its features and demographics. He shared his marketing plan. Based on his ideas of the target price point, this house will likely appeal to a certain customer profile. Large numbers of people are now flocking from Capitol Hill or Georgetown or other congested areas of the city, looking for more space for working remotely and enjoying an expansive private backyard yet not giving up proximity to the city. A second source of prospects would logically be government and large public companies. John’s team’s marketing plan had a development process for leveraging these known targets. Regionally targeted advertising, mostly social, focuses on precise neighborhoods. Good old fashioned networking has been most successful for well placed HR managers and recruiters. Lifestyle and opportunity is their common language. John’s profiling described prospective buyer types. The house had to speak directly to them. The kitchen needed cosmetic upgrades. The paint and carpet needed cosmetic refreshes. The staging all needed to complement what they see in the store showrooms. And to accomplish all this, Compass Concierge provides the house refresh financing, due and payable interest free upon settlement. Even better, the team of John Eric & Trevor Moore, take ownership of project management, driven expertly by Janis Hicks, overseeing contractor selection, workmanship quality and expeditious implementation. Slam dunk. I didn’t tell John that he had me at this point without yet having had the pricing discussion. As to price, John produced his analysis of comparables. John’s comparable review suggested a number significantly higher than the other realtors. Yes, this raised a concern but it was supported by a well reasoned argument. Supply and demand played strongly in his logic as did the emotional appeal of the house features. Don’t envision the house as it is now. Picture it as it will be. The strength of his argument was bolstered by his methodical process. John’s listing price, when brought to market, would be informed by multiple datapoints including his own evaluation, a formal pricing gaggle of high performing realtors in our market, plus John’s own contracted formal appraisal. When I asked other realtors to explain their marketing plan for our house, I was universally met with, “once we list your home on MLS, I will be the best negotiator you have ever seen…” John’s marketing, “The house won’t even make it to MLS. Any true buyer making it to the bidding discussion will be competing on maximum price or I haven’t done my job of preparing them to bid.” The result, 30 days from the day we gave the team of John Eric & Trevor Moore the go ahead, we settled on the sale. The settlement was wonderfully uneventful. We were wowed. – Howard and Gloria John and his team define a professional Real Estate office. They are attentive, responsive and available and turned what can be a stressful life experience into a pleasurable exchange. John went out of his way to ensure that the needs of my family were being met, and always with professional grace. Listing or buying? I could not recommend John and his team more! – Luke and Mary F. John Eric was wonderful! John was very helpful communicating all the necessary steps to get our house sold so we could move forward with our move across the country. He did everything and more to get us to the finish line. I am beyond grateful for everything John and his team did for us. I highly recommend them. – Kathie R. John Eric is an excellent realtor. We worked with John and his team to purchase and sell several homes in Northern Virginia and are always thrilled with his market expertise and flawless execution. John's attention to detail goes beyond a simple checklist. He takes ownership of the entire process, going above and beyond to help his clients find the perfect home and providing a seamless experience in the administration of documentation and inspections. We always felt like John's most important clients, and he goes out of his way to provide white-glove service and a positive attitude. Additionally, we always felt that we could trust John and his team to keep the process moving, providing incredible peace of mind during what could potentially be a stressful and draining time. We enthusiastically recommend John to any buyer or seller in the DC market, regardless of budget. Thank you John, Trevor, Janis and the entire Compass team! – Chip and Ali We recently made a quick decision to buy a home in Florida, but that meant selling our townhouse in Arlington, VA quickly. I knew of John and Trevor through other sales in our community, so decided to give them a call. They came right out, and took over from (in a good way) the start. Everything was explained in simple terms for us to understand. John and Trevor brought in a stager (Claudia) a delightful lady and they turned our townhouse into a magazine model. Each morning when I woke up, I did not know where I was, but the house SOLD in 2.5 days.Lots of papers to sign, and lots to do, but with their guidance it was done in a calming easy way. Then we were turned over to Janis, whom I believe is John’s assistant in their real estate office. Again, what a pleasure to work with her. She would email us things to read, ask questions about, and to sign. Every document Janis would send us was easy to understand and we were told to ask any questions, and then once we completely understood what we were signing, we would sign and send right back to her.I can not stress enough how hard it is to sell your home of 20 years, the emotions ran high, but this team made the transition smooth and easy. The emotions were still there, but they helped us through that time. - Tom and Bill A huge Thanks to John and Trevor @ Compass for selling our Arlington home in 3 days! Their team eased the stress of a fast corporate relocation and took care of everything for us on the ground while we were already relocated and living in Dallas. From staging to landscaping, they handled everything to maximize our sale! Super easy and highly recommended! - Chris Womack & Brandon Patchett We retained John and Trevor to sell our condo after 2 prior sales efforts had failed. Jointly, using their candid assessments of the condo market, we explored all options and set a sales goal. John and Trevor were efficient and effective in their marketing and soon identified and engaged potential buyers. They achieved a deal at our asking price in a very short time. All objectives for this sale were met and the closing was well-managed, which Shelly made happen. We would recommend this team without reservation. - Steve & Karen John Eric and his team were the perfect realtors. I do realize perfect is a strong word and I mean it. They responded almost immediately to every question or request. They priced the unit spot-on, recommended reasonable upgrades, coordinated getting those upgrades and a few repairs completed, and kept me up to date on everything. Because of these actions, the home sold quickly and at a great price. At every stop, they were transparent about options and actions, there were no hidden fees, and prices charged for work were completely fair. The team is professional and knowledgeable. I have closed (one side or the other) over a dozen times in recent years and this was by far the smoothest and most low stress closing I’ve ever experienced. - E. Nelson I just have to say that working with Trevor and John was a dream experience! They were professional, courteous and prompt in all his communications and actions. I couldn’t think of anything that just was not top notch about the whole experience! They even had recommendations for the moving company and handyman that I needed to complete the relocation process. I wouldn’t dream of using anyone else for all of my real estate needs! - Julie Siemers John Eric and Trevor Moore were outstanding in every respect! Incredibly helpful, efficient and responsive, everything went like a breeze and the house sold for exactly what they said it would despite lower initial estimates from other Realtors. They came warmly recommended by neighbors who were absolutely right! - Jean F. Delpech We worked with John Eric and Trevor Moore during our relocation to Virginia earlier this year. We were unfamiliar with the area and needed someone knowledgeable who could provide strong guidance. We hit the jackpot with John and Trevor. Relocation is complicated by the need for good schools, sports programs, a doable commute and all the little things that go beyond an actual real estate purchase. From our very first phone conversation with John, we were impressed by his knowledge of the areas we were considering. We met both John and Trevor when they showed us homes in various areas around Nova. As corny as it sounds, it truly was like getting two for one. They both offer unique talents and we always felt like we had someone holding our hand. We decided we loved Vienna which had low inventory. After they showed us every property available that met our criteria, we ended up purchasing a home that was not listed after Trevor scoured the area and found it. John and Trevor were able to manage the whole transaction and represented us well. We would definitely use them again and highly recommend them. - Jackie Vaughn John Eric Trevor Moore and Associates are realtors who go well above and beyond when it comes to selling your home. The amount of time, energy and effort that they put into selling our home is what makes them most stand out. Not only did they recommend improvements that we could do to help sell our house at a higher price, they had the vendors to do the work and even oversaw the changes. They will be as involved as you’d like… they will coordinate and oversee every aspect of selling your home, or they will work in conjunction with you to get the job done. JETMA had multiple homes that they were in the process of selling and not once did we feel like just a number, or as if they weren’t working 100% on selling our home. Very responsive, always attentive and also a fun group to boot! I enjoyed working with JETMA so much, I decided to join the team!- Colette Bryan John, Trevor and Janis are professional, friendly, helpful and very energetic. I highly recommend them. I bought a condo a few years ago where John was the selling agent. I was so impressed with John and his team that I recently had them sell a property for me. They made a complex sale easy for me. They ensured a top dollar valuation of the property by advertising it aggressively as well as helping with some last minute repairs. Truly, they helped across the full spectrum of what a top tier real estate team should do to help their client. I trust them implicitly. John and the team are experts in the DC area – a true pleasure to work with too! - Kirk We recently made a quick decision to buy a home in Florida, but that meant selling our townhouse in Arlington, VA quickly.

She's so easy to deal with, has great taste and was able to weed through the junk to find what I was looking for. Don't go anywhere else, Lynne is your agent!! \" - D. Breier \"Outstanding. Lynne is affable, capable, and accommodating.\" - L. Kutcher \"It was wonderful! Lynne is not only a well-informed and conscientious real estate agent but a wonderful person in so many ways. We were \"telephone\" introduced originally by our agent in California and he said that he thought we were a great match. He was absolutely correct. Lynne assisted us in so many ways. We arrived from California with little knowledge of Connecticut and certainly were not prepared for the house sale boom here. Lynne graciously arranged multiple property showings for us, including areas that were farther away for her. Lynne always did her \"due diligence\" and provided us with information about the property, the city, etc. There are attributes such as punctuality, determination, intelligence, and politeness to name a few that she certainly possesses, but it is her kind-heartedness and compassion that sets her apart. When needed, Lynne was always readily available with words of encouragement or sage advice. It is evident that she is an extraordinary person who not only is extremely knowledgeable in her field, but also a person who cares deeply about her clients. We feel extremely fortunate to have had her on \"our side\" representing our best interests. We would recommend Lynne in a heart beat.\" - S. Braz \"As we began our search for a house in Westport, we met Lynne at an open house she was running and immediately knew that we wanted to have her be our buyers agent. She’s super funny, kind, wise and a straight shooter. As soon-to-be transplants from the City, she immediately “got us,” what we wanted and perhaps more importantly what we didn’t want. As we began our search, Lynne was super helpful and knowledgeable in explaining the pros and cons of each of the towns around Westport, including Weston, Fairfield, Wilton. But Lynne is a Westport gal at heart and her love of the town shines through. We spent probably 5 weekends with Lynne looking at houses. Not only was it super fun, but she was not pushy at all and stayed on top follow-up tours and continually refined the search as we went along. When we finally found the house that we loved, she worked insanely hard to to get the price down, ultimately securing us a very good deal on a historic home with a pool within walking distance of town — all things on our list of “would like to have but not dealbreakers.” We highly recommend Lynne and have in fact recommend her to numerous friends thinking of moving to the area. She’s good people and you could not find a better buyers agent in the Westport area. And if we ever sell our house, no question Lynne will be selling it.\" - S. Elliott \"Fantastic! Lynne went above and beyond during our search - she was incredibly responsive communicating with us, and really proactive when it came to finding the perfect home for us despite trying market conditions! \" - A. & S. Slade \"To put it bluntly: Lynne is the best. Yes, that may come across as hyperbole, but the truth is that Lynne's depth of knowledge about Westport brought us a sense of calm and ease in what has been a relentless and hectic real estate market. Not only did she understand exactly what we were looking for, but she was proactive and helpful in showing us different parts of town and a variety of homes. Some which we didn't even think would be on our radar. When we found a place that we quickly fell in love with, her expertise shined further. She always acted in our best interest, gave invaluable advice, and educated us on the process: from finalizing our bids to referring vendors inspection/closing/etc. Lynne is someone that cares deeply about her clients and will go the extra mile to help. She's not just an excellent agent, but we also are lucky enough to now call her a friend!\" - B. & B. Groat \"Our experience with Lynne and Jake was perfect and they were such a pleasure to work with. We were searching for our first home during the very competitive Covid market, and they truly made this milestone a breeze. We were relatively new to the area and they took the time to show us all around Fairfield County to confirm which area was best for us. As we toured houses, Lynne and Jake always gave us their honest opinion and expertise. They made us feel like family, and it was a very personable experience. Their communication was top notch, and they were always available to talk every step of the way. Once we found our house, Lynne and Jake’s knowledge of the market made it easy to trust their recommendation for our initial offer, and guidance throughout the brief negotiation process. We had an accepted offer within a few days and had a seamless closing. They knew all the right people in the area to connect with from lawyers, inspectors, and general contractors. Whenever something came up, Lynne and Jake were there to take care of it. There was a point in which the garage needed to be further inspected, and instead of us traveling from out of state, they were able to handle it. Lynne and Jake went above and beyond for us, and before we knew it, we were officially homeowners! Lynne and Jake are the best team in Fairfield County, and we highly recommend them for anyone looking to have an enjoyable home buying experience!\" - A. & J. Alleva \"Lynne is wonderful. She genuinely listens to her clients’ requests, works so hard for them, and is a good-hearted, friendly person. Some people are just a perfect fit for what they do, and she is one of those people.\" - J. Betancourt \"I cannot say enough wonderful things about both Jake and Lynne. Searching for our home while navigating a challenging market felt desperate at times. They made even the most difficult and disappointing days more enjoyable and hopeful. Their willingness to go above and beyond to support and guide our search made those days so much easier. Ultimately, they found us the home of our dreams and we could not be happier. We consider ourselves lucky to have found such a great team to take on one of life's biggest challenges. You really can't go wrong with this generous, dedicated and capable team. We love you Jake and Lynne!! Thank you for everything!!\" - K.

We bonded over shared personal and professional values and a deep commitment to always put our clients’ interests above our own. Sam and Orysia transitioned to Compass around the same time in 2017. Our respective businesses continued to flourish, and it seemed natural to join forces to provide our best practices and complimentary styles of service. Thirty years of combined real estate expertise, we are proud to share our deep industry knowledge with a diverse set of clients. While we continue to work independently with our respective base of clients, we have a collaborative approach when it comes to utilizing the cutting-edge marketing and data driven technology that serves all of our buyers and sellers equally well. Sam and Orysia support one another, so that we can ultimately better support a growing network of clients. In 2022, The Solovey group welcomed Jon Solovey who is not only a successful Realtor, but also Sam's older brother. Jon had an amazingly productive 2021 at another local brokerage and decided it was time bring his success and momentum to our team in order to support our growing network of buyers and sellers. The Sam Solovey Group is proud to have achieved more than $40M in sales in 2021 and an equally impressive 2022 and 2023 as well. In 2023, the group welcomed Mary Zitello who has enjoyed a lengthy and prosperous real estate career in the DMV. In fact, she too worked with Sam and Orysia at their prior brokerage in Chevy Chase, so we have completed the \"family reunion.\" Sam has been married 20 years to his wife Lori, and they have 3 boys aged 14, 12 and 9 as well as their 2 year old Aussiedoodle named Charlotte. In Sam's free time, he loves to run, bike, do anything and everything with his family and has recently discovered pickleball. Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \" Sam was tremendous. We are first-time homebuyers and had a lot to learn about pretty much everything relating to home buying and ownership. There was no question or issue too small for Sam's full attention, and we knew right from our first interaction that he was someone who cares deeply about the people he's helping, not just making a sale. Our search lasted roughly three months and Sam's guidance was crucial during every phase of the search. Whether it was in formulating our priorities, digging deeper on property details, or final negotiations, Sam was always willing and able to provide all the information needed for us to make decisions. He would regularly say that these decisions were ours, but his emails were usually so thorough that we'd have been crazy not to follow his advice. This attention to detail did not wane even during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we would not have blamed Sam if it did! Ultimately, we are happy in our new home but we did have a tinge of regret after purchase knowing that we'd no longer get to work with Sam. \" - Bobby H ★★★★★ \" I enjoyed and appreciated working with Sam. Sam is smart, direct and honest. He thinks creatively about how to achieve the outcome one is looking for, and he has excellent resources to call upon. I also liked that Sam is very responsive to all forms of communication. The sale of our house was drama free, and Sam guided us smoothly through the process.

You really are the most memorable (you look like Colin Jost) and the best real estate agent we have had. - Jonathan Dalamo ★★★★★ “Scott is just the top of the game, and not just because he can sell a house or find you one.

He was spot on! 8 offers in a matter of days and thousands above asking! He also had ideas on how to make our move efficient and helped us make connections in our new community.

In fact, our new house was not even on our radar until Scott suggested we check it out. We are very happy with how things worked out and appreciate the work of this team.\" - Brian Kenny ★★★★★ Daniel & the team at The Synergy Group are phenomenal real estate professionals who I could not recommend more highly. As we were looking to buy, Daniel consistently was able to get us into houses right as they hit the market (and in some cases, before). His relationships and neighborhood expertise allowed us to get an offer in early and ultimately beat substantial competition. I can say definitively we would not have gotten our house if it wasn't for Daniel. I am very grateful for all his hard work for us and I cannot recommend him enough. - Matthew Filosa ★★★★★ \"Five Star experience all the way.

Closing went smoothly thanks to Scott Sachs staying on top of several moving parts. Highly and without reservations recommend Scott and his Synergy Group team..\" - Diana Mangano-Cohen ★★★★★ \"My family has relied on Daniel Schuler for buying, selling, and advice. He has delivered superior service and phenomenal results. Daniel helped our family plan and execute a that exceeded our very high expectations during a very difficult time following a death in our family. Despite being a high demand/high volume agent, he distinguished himself with his ability to listen with care and provide a personalized approach to the transaction. He took the time to understand our values and objectives. He demonstrated expertise and market insight to the strongest possible strategy to execute our vision. No detail was overlooked.

He made the whole process as easy for as possible. He is professional, courteous, and reliable - he was always one step ahead of our questions. He was extremely knowledgeable about small repairs/steps we could take in selling our apartment and we ended up selling for over asking price! As first-time single-family home buyers, he was responsive to all of our needs. He walked us through the financing, inspection, and negotiated closing cost credit and seller repairs. He hooked us up with a contractor to refinish our and entertained our two--old during our closing.

In the past few years alone, the team has sold more than $110 million of residential real estate to discerning buyers from the World Bank, IFC, IMF, IBD, UN, Amazon, US State Department, White House, Middle Eastern Royal Families, Global Businessmen, and many other organizations. Recipients of multiple awards years after year (Washingtonian & America’s Top 100 Best/Top Producers and Real Trends to name a few), The Toni A. Ghazi Group continues to perform and out-performs itself consistently. Client Testimonials Scroll down for more Toni helped my partner and I rent our first apartment in DC and then purchase a home in Capitol Hill two years later. All of his five star reviews will tell you how great of an agent he is (so true). But moreover, Toni is a great person, and that is the reason why I loved working with him and will recommend him to any of my friends who are looking for a home in the area. 1) Toni is judgement-free. Of all the places we saw, he was supportive, whether we liked the place or not and genuinely wanted us to be happy. He was never judgmental about our budget for our first home and didn't try to push us out of our comfort zone. He stuck with us until we found what was right for us. 2) I wanted to take one last look at a house on a Sunday evening before I put an offer in. I ended up changing my mind after seeing the house again, but Toni dropped what he was doing and rushed from the gym to the house to help me. The house we were looking at was abandoned mid-reno and was a bit of a disaster. He helped me figure out all of the houses' quirks for two hours-- if there were original wood floors under the laminate, if we could salvage any of the trim work, etc. He could've been doing something much more exciting on a Sunday night than lifting up dirty old flooring with me. He always took his time with us, and you would never think that he had several other clients. 3) He'll advocate for you and be on your team. There are countless times where I didn't think to ask for something, but he was always one step ahead of us and went above and beyond what I would've expected. Thank you, Toni! - Allyce M - November 2020 Toni is a reliable, knowledgeable, friendly, patient and resourceful agent! We have been working with him for over 2 years, he first helped us find a condo for rent and later another one for purchase. During the rent search, we were pressed for time and he saw 10+ condos with us in less than 2 days and helped finalize all the paperwork within the same time - super efficient! During the buying process - he patiently saw 50(??)+ units with us all across DC and Arlington, spread out over 6 months - he listened carefully and always always responded to all our needs and preferences, answered our countless questions and put with all our idiosyncrasies with a smile! Super thankful for all his help and hardworking in working with us and will always appreciate his efforts- couldn't have asked for a better agent! - Bratiral D -September 2020. We just purchased our second home with Toni and he was absolutely amazing to work with. He left no detail behind and was so on top of every part of the process. In fact, we had a lot of difficulty with our lender being behind and he was terrific with helping stay on top of them for deadlines to make sure we were protected throughout the process and that our closing was not pushed back. Toni is not only know knowledgeable and experienced, but he is a true pleasure to work with. We wouldn’t want to have anyone else at our side and on our side when we buy a home. - Amanda D – September 2020 Toni was a great help, from start to finish. He is experienced, kind and helpful, and works seemingly all the time around the clock to help you. But he is also not aggressive or pushy with you as his client. I trusted him completely, which in the end is the most important trait when choosing between the 100s of realtors out there. I also really appreciate how non-judgmental he is - of your choices, and your timing, and ultimately of what works for you. He takes big shot clients and normal people clients, and works just as hard for everyone. I would highly recommend him - Genevieve C - September 2020 OH MY GOD! What an absolute pleasure it was to work with Toni to sell my tony Capitol Hill townhome. He is very professional and was able to provide me with an honest assessment of my property and needed updates to make it more attractive. Tony managed the renovations, the staging, the marketing, and the sale in an exceptional manner. I left town and relied on Toni to manage the entire process - I am so glad I did! Toni - thank you; thank you; thank you!!!! I cannot fully express my appreciation for all that you did for us!!!! - Scott C – September 2020 Working with Toni was absolutely wonderful. I have the utmost respect for and confidence in Toni's knowledge, experience, skill, ability and expertise in the real estate world. At one of the worst times, he was able to successfully, and in an amazingly short period of time, sell my elderly sister's condo. In addition to his professional excellence, I found him to be very caring, compassionate and understanding. He always lifted my spirits. Additionally, his response time to my calls, emails, texts was almost immediate. I can't say enough good things about Toni and I highly recommend him. - Nita T. – August 2020 Toni is an amazing realtor and wonderful to work with. As a first-time home buyer, I was anxious before beginning my search, but Toni put me at ease right away. I knew instantly I was in the best hands. I had a million questions, and Toni answered every single one, within minutes of me calling/emailing/texting. He is extremely responsive and not only arranged showings for anything I wanted to look at but also asked great questions to understand better what I was looking for. He was there for me every step of the way, and I am so grateful to Toni for making home buying a smooth and exciting process! - Emma P. – August, 2020", "social": {}, "email": "toniaghazigroup@compass.com", "title": "", "agent_phone_numbers": ["5712161075", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

She's very responsive, understands the home-buying process very well, and makes you feel at ease and confident during what can easily be a stressful and chaotic process. I would definitely work with her again. \u0012 - Peter F. ★★★★★ \u0012 We both bought and sold our home with Ashling. She's an amazing person to have in your corner. Our sale became complicated and she worked extra hard to get it closed. She was there offer advice every step of the way. I would not hesitate to recommend her. \u0012 - Jonathan M. ★★★★★ \u0012 Ashling was super helpful in every step in our house sale: thoughtful approach to market, house prep and presentation, open house and communication with us and the prospective buyers. I would 100 percent work with her again. \u0012 - Mark H. ★★★★★ \u0012 Ashling was tremendous during the whole process.

I have already recommended her to my sister and other family members looking for a home. She is extremely trustworthy, efficient, practical and just a great person all around! She even sent me a beautiful gift basket after I bought the house!

The availability of a specific house was the only reason I undertook the project. I was familiar with Ashling Thurmond, and felt confident in her skills and character. I was not disappointed. She first reviewed the entire process at an initial meeting and provided me with handouts to reinforce the information. She kept in steady contact. That included status reports and reminders of things I needed to carry out. Her contacts with firms needed for a purchase were also professional, competent, and thorough. That includes an inspector and a settlement firm. She was present at meetings with them.

Coming from the area equips Brandon with an incredible wealth of knowledge about the region and the truly invaluable perspective of a born and bred local. \"Being from the area gives me a perspective that is extremely valuable to my clients, especially clients newer to DC.” Buying a home for the first time is one of life’s big checkpoints. Brandon’s knowledge of the DMV, coupled with the work he does to understand each clients’ needs, helps him excel at making a seemingly confusing process almost elementary. “I enjoy being the reason people are having a good time! So part of what I do with buyers, is make sure I take on the stress and navigate the tougher parts of deals, this keeps the good times rolling for my clients in the meantime!” Brandon has also cultivated a vast network from volunteering and being an active participant with many LGBTQ organizations. Some of the many charities who have benefited from the work Brandon has done include SMYAL, DC Scores, and The Thurgood Marshall Center Trust. One of Brandon’s passions is soccer. In 2018, Brandon and his team had the incredible experience of playing in the Gay Games held in Paris, France where they won the Silver Medal. \"It's wonderful to be able to walk around and know so many people. DC has everything any other major city has, but retains a small town feel. This creates a really rich sense of community and I enjoy sharing the love I have for DC with my clients. I've worked really hard to build my reputation locally and to foster great relationships with colleagues in every lane of the real estate industry. Because of this, in a business built on relationships, familiarity and name recognition being critical, I can better serve my clients.\"", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/BrandonWarnerResidential", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-warner-673257b6"}, "email": "brandon.warner@compass.com", "title": "Realtor®", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2405158923", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

Over the past 25 years, Mary Lynn has devoted herself full-time to her true passion for real estate. Her in-depth market knowledge and expertise in ensuring seamless transactions have formed the foundation of her highly successful business. In addition, her keen eye for design, savvy negotiation skills, and ability to develop an immediate rapport with clients have enabled her to assist clients effectively at every stage of the search and sell process. No wonder she's ranked in the top 1% of real estate agents nationwide! Though her life's course has entailed traveling the world – and even getting her pilot's license – today, Mary Lynn keeps both feet on the ground at home in the Palisades where she lives with Alice, her 1-year-old Maltese. Testimonials: \"No challenge is too big for Mary Lynn. Her market expertise, unparalleled attention to detail, and deep network delivered what seemed impossible in just one week. She meticulously prepared our home, listed it at the perfect price, and ensured we were under contract with multiple offers over asking. A positive, profitable process from beginning to end and we owe it all to Mary Lynn.\" -Andrew H. \"Selling the beloved house we had lived in for fifty-one years was going to be one of the hardest things we've ever had to do. However, having Mary Lynn White as our real estate agent made all the difference. She had come highly recommended to us by a friend who had used her services and adored her, and after we interviewed her (she was one of three agents we interviewed), it was clear she was the right one for us. First of all, she loved and appreciated our house. Secondly, she was clear and straightforward in all her ideas about how and when to sell it. Every step of the way, from the moment we agreed to work together through settlement, she was accommodating, full of helpful suggestions, willing and eager to do whatever had to be done, and--this is not unimportant--delightful to be with. We would recommend Mary Lynn--gracious, tactful, and really good at her work--to anyone who wants to sell a house.\" - Judith and Milton Viorst \"Thank you for your wonderful work selling our house. I will never forget how you made it all so stress-free when I was hundreds of miles away. You truly are a miracle worker. I will let anyone I know what a dream you are!\" - Teri R. \"This is the fourth house we've entrusted to Mary Lynn. Regardless of size and price, she treats our homes with the same level of attention, professionalism, and passion. Tom and I couldn't imagine buying or selling without Mary Lynn.\" - Tom and Loi \"Mary Lynn White is the consummate professional and the most effective realtor I have seen. She has guided me through 11 home purchases or sales over 20 years. Mary Lynn does her homework regarding comparables and purchase prices. For sales, she stages in a highly effective way. For purchases, she understands market conditions and expertly guides the bid structure/process. In addition, Mary Lynn is very personable and easy to work with. In my view, one could not find a better agent.\" - Alan F. \"I recently sold my home and knew I wanted to use Mary Lynn as my agent. I watched as she successfully staged and marketed five homes in my neighborhood, all getting multiple offers above similar sold homes. I was overwhelmed with the thought of getting rid of household items accumulated over the years. Mary Lynn put together a plan with a list of resources (organizers, contractors, donation pickups, etc.) that enabled me to accomplish everything quickly and efficiently. We staged my home with her guidance, and sure enough, the house sold over asking. She is the consummate professional, and I have recommended her to several friends who felt exactly the same way.\" - Diane S. \"She provided exceptional service and allowed me to actually enjoy the selling process. She and her team covered all the bases, including preparing the house for the market and informing us of her many strategies. I would recommend her without any hesitation. She was the best!\" - Craig H. \"Rochelle, I wanted to express my thanks to you and Mary Lynn White for the wonderful work you did selling my current house and assisting in purchasing my new cooperative unit. Mary Lynn has been a great support for me during this whole process. I didn't even know if anyone would want to buy my house, considering that the house next door was to be torn down and an enormous new house built in its place over the next year or so. But Mary Lynn persevered and gave me hope. She brought in a stager to stage my house for sale. She brought in a yard person to spruce up the yard. She brought in window washers for the windows and skylights. In the end, my house looked like one that should be a TV show like the Property Brothers. And then, during the open house, she spent four days, Friday through Monday, showing potential buyers my house. By Monday afternoon, we had three offers. It was a miracle. And, the miracle continued. The next day, by luck, I found a cooperative unit for sale nearby. I offered to buy it a week later, and Mary Lynn immediately put together a sales contract for me and the seller (who was not represented by an agent). It was all a very smooth transition, including her assistance with the closing on both properties. And did I mention that she brought in an interior designer to help me choose the new paint colors for my new apartment? It will be beautiful. And she recommended a painter to me. Mary Lynn is one-stop shopping for all of one's real estate needs. I think she is great. I would recommend her to anyone seeking a Real Estate Agent.

Originally from Silver Spring, MD, Kate has called many of DC’s neighborhoods home over the years. If you’re an animal lover and Kate looks familiar, perhaps you had the good fortune to meet Kate White, DVM, at Atlas Vet, where she worked for many years as a veterinarian, caring for our most precious companions. From age 12, Kate dreamed of becoming a veterinarian. She obtained her undergraduate degree in animal science from the University of Connecticut, and in 2016, earned her doctor of veterinary medicine degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, making that dream a reality. Kate’s dedication to animal health took her on an incredible journey, from China to Africa, from Grenada to California, finally landing back in DC’s H Street neighborhood. After much contemplation and soul-searching, in 2023 Kate made the bold decision to transition from veterinary medicine to real estate. Kate yearned for a new path that could bring people, and their beloved pets, a sense of well-being and tranquility. Guiding individuals and families to find their ideal refuge and place to call home became Kate's calling, a challenging privilege she wholeheartedly embraces. What sets Kate apart in the real estate industry is her unwavering passion for her clients—and the trust they place in her. (After all, you wouldn’t let just anyone care for your pet, would you?) Kate believes that real estate is not just about transactions, but about creating fulfilling experiences for her clients. With an acute understanding of the market and a medical professional’s eye for detail, Kate ensures that every client's needs are met with precision and care. Her local expertise and in-depth knowledge of the Washington, DC, area make Kate an invaluable resource for both buyers and sellers.

Ultimately, Kate cherishes any time spent with amazing people, delicious food, picturesque landscapes, and the purest joy that animals bring.

She's leveraged her law degree, professional coaching certification, education work, and a passion for real estate into one holistic package for her clients—finding the perfect home in a neighborhood that meets their needs. As a former AmeriCorps volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, where she helped build a 100 home neighborhood post Hurricane Andrew, she has a keen eye for a home’s potential and loves finding unique solutions to interesting homeowner challenges. She first moved to Washington, DC, in 2000 to attend Georgetown Law School, graduating in 2003 and passing the NY Bar the same year. In the past twenty five plus years in the DC area, she's lived in Silver Spring, Adams Morgan, Bloomingdale, Columbia Heights, Petworth, Forest Glen, and Takoma DC. Jaime thrives on working with thoughtful, curious clients who appreciate a data-driven approach, clear communication, and strategic decision-making. Her Ideal clients value expertise, seek to be well-informed, and trust in a collaborative process—whether they’re first-time buyers, sellers navigating their next chapter, or policy-minded professionals making a smart move. Jaime balances market insights with deep empathy, ensuring that every client feels heard, prepared, and empowered. The goal isn’t just to close deals—it’s to ensure that a year down the road, clients still feel great about their choices, their investment, and their home. With a commitment to putting people over transactions and anticipating client needs to keep the process as smooth as possible, Jaime is the agent of choice for those who want a knowledgeable and client-focused real estate experience. She genuinely loves her work, and a lot of her free time is spent on work-related research projects. But if she's not working, she enjoys being politically engaged—election nights are her Super Bowl, and she walked down the aisle to The West Wing theme song. She loves traveling and has currently visited 48 US States and 23 Countries and counting. She's a very proud aunt to six nephews and five nieces and works hard to earn the distinction of being “fiercely loyal” to her closest friends and family. She lives in Takoma DC, with her husband, Benjamin, a federal government IT programmer, and their three rescue cats in a home they \"finished\" renovating in 2024 (the project list doesn't ever really end, does it?). Client Testimonials ★★★★★ \" We have just completed the process of selling our family home and I am compelled to give my review of how the process went. First, and foremost, Jaime is the most proficient and professional agent that I have worked with. I am a retired and Urban Designer that has worked both nationally and internationally and know that the buying and selling process can result in high amounts of stress.\" \" Jaime was far beyond what most will do in this process. She did the research on our property before we actually contracted with her to sell the property. Once we were formally engaged she handled everything related to clearing the house of furniture, keeping us informed with regular updates on every action that we needed to do as sellers, and was incredibly knowledgeable of the neighborhood that I have lived in for over 50 years.\" \" The neighborhood that I live in has always been a desired location in Washington DC and when word got out that we were selling the house there were a plethora of attempting to represent our family. Jaime was far beyond what other were proposing. I live across the street from the property that we were selling, which provided an excellent opportunity to observe her actions in showing the house. She was just amazingly flawless and so on point with everything that needed to be done.\" \" Jaime’s professional interpersonal skills makes it very easy to talk with her…she listens exceptionally well and gives solid feed-back that effectively presents options for our consideration. When engaging with her it’s like she is a member of our family with the objective of representing and protecting our interests and desires. More importantly, she understands the nuance vibe of the neighborhood which enabled her to effectively present the property to potential buyers (over 100 people looked at the house).\" \" I must also mention that she completed all of what was necessary to do to sell the property within six months during the Fall and Winter in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.. simply amazing. I would highly recommend securing Jaime’s services if anyone was interested in selling or buying property. I have given out all of her cards that I had to both my friends and professional associates…even while on the golf course! Finally, I have to also mention that Jaime and KVS Title worked so well together that there was simply no stress in the process…it reminded me of a symphonic harmony.\" -David H. ★★★★★ \" I want to write the most amazing review for simply one of the most gifted and brilliant realtors you will ever have the pleasure to work with when finding the home of your dreams. My fear is anyone who reads this will think Jaime Willis paid me to do it! She did not, lol.\" \" I needed to find an adorable and peaceful home for me and my mentally challenged, yet lovable dog, Sammy. I was living in Massachusetts when the search began and did not have the time nor the inclination to travel down to DC to find it. I trusted Jaime sooooo much we made an offer on a Bungalow in MD, right across the DC border, sight unseen (well me!). She negotiated a better price for me, and she worked beautifully with the seller's agent. Nothing ever felt difficult, or stressful for me, but I know it must have been incredibly challenging for Jaime during the Covid-19 era to make multiple trips to the property without me, and to know that her client was entrusting and expecting her to make decisions so that I could focus on other critical matters in my life. Imagine that stress when half a million bucks is on the line? Jaime took on the challenge with grace and kindness.\" \" Before the closing she made sure my home was professionally cleaned (who does that?!), she helped me find the right alarm system, she installed (herself!) a NEST thermostat so I could control my home's HVAC remotely cause I travel often, she bought a cute dog bowl for my pooch, and put soap and other supplies in my bathrooms. She even had my lawn mowed so it looked extra posh. I mean, come on, who does these things? Jaime Willis DOES!!\" \" Jaime is highly intelligent, an attorney training, with real estate acumen second to none. She made it fun, exciting, and meaningful. You will not only fall in love with your new home if you work with Jaime, you will fall in love with her! I am gay so I can say that, lol.\" \" Jaime thank you from the bottom of my heart for making this single dog dad happier than he could have ever imagined.\" \" As for those reading this, Jaime, in two words, is a saintly star. -Scott S", "social": {}, "email": "jaime@compass.com", "title": "Realtor - Licensed in DC, MD, and VA", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2024941325", "3012981001"], "office_phone_numbers": ["3012981001"]}

Steve assisted us 5 years ago with the purchase of a townhouse in Arlington. That experience was so positive that we stayed in touch over the years and when we were ready to move again, we knew without question that we wanted Steve to work with us on both the sale of our townhouse and the purchase of our new house. Steve and his team are truly fantastic -- very knowledgeable about the area and the market, responsive, and great about educating us, full of fantastic recommendations of vendors to use), and just really pleasant people to be around during what can be a stressful situation! Unbelievably, with Steve's marketing and good advice, our townhouse was under contract in one day and we never even had to have an open house. We ideally wanted to close on the sale of our townhouse as quickly as possible because we already had a date for the closing on the purchase of our new house. Everything went off without a hitch with both closings taking place on the same day, within 3 weeks of having a ratified contract. We would recommend Steve and his team to anyone. Great service; great people. \" ★★★★★ \" Steve Wydler and his team are simply the best at what they do. My husband and I have worked with them in buying and selling our home. During the home-buying process, Steve was patient, attentive to our requests, kind, and detailed in letting us know the positives and negatives in each home we considered. When we were ready to sell our home, he was meticulous and determined to get us the best deal in this economy. Thanks to Steve and his team’s hard work, efforts, and great advice, we got an offer on the house in less than one week. Bottom line: if you want to find your dream home, the person to contact is Steve Wydler; if you want to sell your home fast and for the best possible price, the person to contact is Steve Wydler. \" ★★★★★ \" We worked with Steve on the purchase of a new home in McLean, and the sale of our existing McLean house. Steve and his team did a terrific job of helping us get our existing home ready to sell, and it sold before the open house. He and his team helped us evaluate the homes on the market, handled all of the negotiations, and we ended up with the house we wanted. Steve did a great job explaining the process and leading us through the various steps. It ended up being much easier than expected. He has a great team of professionals, as well as extensive knowledge of local resources. Highly recommended! \" ★★★★★ \" It was a pleasure working with Steve. He staged our house well and was knowledgeable about the neighborhood and the people who would be interested in purchasing. He kept us apprised through the whole process. We highly recommend him. \" ★★★★★ \" Steve lead a team of professionals who work very hard, effective, and efficient in presenting the house on the market, keeping us informed coming and going, and taking care of all details of the transactions. We learned a lot from this experience and have a real appreciation of how complicated a house sale is - it's really the best leaving it to the best professional. We were glad Steve was our agent. We recommend you check Steve out when selling or buying a house. \"", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/stevewydler/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-wydler-5282a7", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/WydlerBrothers", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/stevewydlergroup/"}, "email": "Steve.Wydler@compass.com", "title": "Associate Broker VA, DC & MD", "agent_phone_numbers": ["7033486326", "7033106111"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7033106111"]}

He also studied as an Erasmus scholar at the University of Grenoble in France. Drawn to the entrepreneurial nature of real estate, Matt enjoys the intricacies of running his own business and is continually grateful that his career allows a unique lens to experience our beautiful city and interact with its residents. He began his real estate career with Long & Foster, became a partner and founding member of Keller Williams Bethesda office, and then was recruited by Compass in 2016 to serve as senior vice president. Matt began his professional journey with Ruesch International as a corporate foreign currency trader and later as the company’s youngest country director in Zurich, Switzerland. Returning to the U.S., he transitioned to consulting and project management with KPMG and Freddie Mac, while earning a master’s degree from Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business. The finance, project management and interpersonal skills he honed during this time were a natural fit for his growing real estate practice. Matt has been active with local civic associations, served as a board member and volunteer for several nonprofits, and is a certified diver in SCUBA. He enjoys Mah Jongg, reading, architecture and traveling internationally (at last count he’s visited 40 countries).", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/dcrealtor_mattzanolli/", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMattZanolliGroup/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattzanolli/"}, "email": "matt.zanolli@compass.com", "title": "Senior Vice President", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2027445799", "2023866330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["2023866330"]}

From quiet suburban streets to vibrant urban neighborhoods, Gregg brings unmatched insight into the communities that make this region such a great place to live. His local knowledge gives buyers and sellers the confidence they need to make smart, informed decisions. A proud graduate of the University of Maryland with a degree in Finance, Gregg’s career spans more than three decades across industries including IT, construction, financial planning, property management, and real estate relocation.

Client Testimonials Scroll down for more ★★★★★ \" It is impossible to overstate how good Greg and Janet are at their profession. They are consummate professionals that know the market. They sold our home before it even went to market and for well over our asking price. In addition to their real estate prowess, they are amazing human beings. They are thoughtful, caring, and empathetic. No question is too small or too big. I highly recommend them without hesitation. \" - Angelo Terrana ★★★★★ \" Gregg was recommended to us when we decided to \"downsize\" after over 20 years in our house. This was not an easy process for us coupled with the nature of our purchase in that we needed to \"move out\" on the sales process at an undetermined point.Gregg exhibited an exemplary level of patience with us and was supportive to us throughout the process, never applying pressure but always providing encouragement and recommendations (and pastries). When the time for us to \"move out\" on the sales process Gregg guided us through each step and the results far exceeded our expectations. I would recommend Gregg to anyone. \" - Mark Burroughs ★★★★★ \" Working with Gregg is truly a dream! He has impeccable style, an eye for detail and a can-do attitude that makes every transaction seamless. He's incredibly professional, always on top of things and consistently finds the best deals for his clients. His mix of expertise, efficiency, and genuine care make him such a pleasure to work with. Highly recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell! \" - Simmons Team ★★★★★ \" As a fellow Realtor, I've had the privilege of working with many Agents both locally and nationally (through referrals both to and from other Agents), but few demonstrate the level of professionalism, skill, integrity, communication skills and client dedication that Gregg Zeiler does. His commitment to excellence and to serving his clients goes far beyond the transaction - he genuinely cares about their goals, concerns and overall experience. It's rare to find someone who balances strong market knowledge with such a warm and service driven approach and who can get the job done. Gregg is a true asset to the industry, the community and his clients. Whether you are buying or selling a home, if you are looking for a Realtor in the MD/VA/DC area that will go above and beyond with professionalism and heart, Gregg is the only one to call! \" - Karen Harned ★★★★★ \" My husband and I recently had the pleasure of working with Gregg & Janet to find my dream first home, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. From the very beginning, they made everything so smooth, efficient, and just plain enjoyable. Their dedication and talent truly shine through! One thing I really appreciate about Gregg and Janet is how well they listen. They make you feel like your needs and wants are their top priority, and they take the time to really understand what you're looking for. Their warm and friendly personalities make the whole journey feel comfortable and supportive. By the time it's all done, you won't just have a fantastic new home—you'll also have some wonderful new friends!I can't recommend Gregg and Janet enough to anyone thinking about buying or selling a home. Their expertise, kindness, and genuine care for their clients really make them stand out. Thank you, Gregg and Janet, for making our home-buying adventure such a memorable one! \" - Gabriel Plazola ★★★★★ \" Our experience with Compass was a total journey. Gregg Zeiler and Janet Million were our experienced guides. Why a total journey, because it was not just one of selling our home, but several factors that could have made the sale difficult. We moved out of state and the house needed to be renovated. We hired a contractor who knew our vision, but Gregg and Janet worked collaboratively with him to plan and execute a design that would increase the value and sales appeal of the home. They encouraged a reasonable timeline completion for a seamless and beautiful transition into a finished product that had market appeal and solid sales value. They kept in communication with us, and we could trust that based on their knowledge of real estate and buyer demand, their decisions were tasteful, reasonable and well executed. We were not disappointed! When completed, the home had multiple viewers and was sold within three days! Should we mention that the sale price was at significant increase in value above other homes previously sold in the area. Our journey could not be completed without our also having to solve the problem of selecting a reliable company to help us with our “cross country” move. We were aware of many “horror” stories of loss and damage by movers. We did research, but were still unsure. Gregg and Janet came to our rescue by giving us an excellent recommendation for a moving company. Again, they were right on target! Everything arrived safely to our new home. The sale of a home can be an emotional and challenging experience, but if you have to make this journey, we could recommend no better guides than Gregg Zeiler and Janet Million at Compass Real Estate. Your successful destination arrival is guaranteed! \" - Barbara and Regina Oglesby ★★★★★ \" I had the pleasure of working with Gregg to purchase my first home, and I can't express how grateful I am for the incredible support and service he provided to me throughout the entire process. From start to finish, he went above and beyond to make my first home purchase as smooth as possible. Gregg patiently answered all of my questions and explained the complexities of the real estate market in a way that was easy for a first-time buyer like me to understand. His level of knowledge, responsiveness and transparency instantly put me at ease and gave me confidence in the decisions I was making. I highly recommend Gregg to anyone in need of a real estate agent who is not only very experienced, but also genuinely cares about his clients' well-being. If you're a first-time homebuyer like me or an experienced buyer, Gregg is the agent you want by your side! \" - Ruben B. ★★★★★ \" We initially worked with Gregg purchasing our home and when it was time to sell he was our first and only call. Gregg is from the area and knew the pluses and minuses of every neighborhood. Much more than his knowledge was his compassion in finding us the best house and then the best deal. We have moved many times in the past 10 years. Gregg is the gold standard. \" - Dennis C. ★★★★★ \" We were lucky enough to stumble upon Gregg through a reference from one of his co-workers. I honestly could not recommend anyone more. At the time, I was in my third trimester with our first child, and my husband and I had about 3 months to find and buy our first home before our apartment lease was up. We had been casually searching on our own for over 6 months with no luck. To say we were in over our heads is an understatement, especially in the DC metro market. From the moment we met Gregg, though, we knew we were in good hands. His experience, availability, desire to help, and generosity made all the difference. In the end, we were able to close about a month before our lease was up, giving us plenty of time to move (especially considering we’ve now got a newborn to handle in the midst of it all). Gregg was vital to making sure the process went smoothly and, without his expertise, there’s no way we could have made this happen. He took what was an incredibly stressful situation and made us feel at ease. Especially as first time buyers, his patience and ability to explain the process made us feel so much more confident in our decisions. If you need a realtor, choose Gregg. I promise you won’t be disappointed. \" -Kristin H. ​​", "social": {"instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/platinumpartnersrealtygroup/", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/p/Platinum-Partners-Realty-Group-100086326276989/"}, "email": "gregg.zeiler@compass.com", "title": "Realtor ® | Vice President | Licensed in DC, MD & VA", "agent_phone_numbers": ["2406887788", "7033106111"], "office_phone_numbers": ["7033106111"]}
